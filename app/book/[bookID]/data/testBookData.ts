    'INTRODUCTION.',
    'THESE Prolegomena are destined for the use, not of pupils, but of future teachers, and even the latter should not expect that they will be serviceable for the systematic exposition of a ready-made science, but merely for the discovery of the science itself.',
    "There are scholarly men, to whom the history of philosophy (both ancient and modern) is philosophy itself; for these the present Prolegomena are not written. They must wait till those who endeavor to draw from the fountain of reason itself have completed their work; it will then be the historian's turn to inform the world of what has been done. Unfortunately, nothing can be said, which in their opinion has not been said before, and truly the same prophecy applies to all future time; for since the human reason has for many centuries speculated upon innumerable objects in various ways, it is hardly to be expected that we should not be able to discover analogies for every new idea among the old sayings of past ages.",
    'My object is to persuade all those who think Metaphysics worth studying, that it is absolutely necessary to pause a moment, and, neglecting all that has been done, to propose first the preliminary question, ‘Whether such a thing as metaphysics be at all possible?’',
    'If it be a science, how comes it that it cannot, like other sciences, obtain universal and permanent recognition? If not, how can it maintain its pretensions, and keep the human mind in suspense with hopes, never ceasing, yet never fulfilled? Whether then we demonstrate our knowledge or our ignorance in this field, we must come once for all to a definite conclusion respecting the nature of this so-called science, which cannot possibly remain on its present footing. It seems almost ridiculous, while every other science is continually advancing, that in this, which pretends to be Wisdom incarnate, for whose oracle every one inquires, we should constantly move round the same spot, without gaining a single step. And so its followers having melted away, we do not find men confident of their ability to shine in other sciences venturing their reputation here, where everybody, however ignorant in other matters, may deliver a final verdict, as in this domain there is as yet no standard weight and measure to distinguish sound knowledge from shallow talk.',
    'After all it is nothing extraordinary in the elaboration of a science, when men begin to wonder how far it has advanced, that the question should at last occur, whether and how such a science is possible? Human reason so delights in constructions, that it has several times built up a tower, and then razed it to examine the nature of the foundation. It is never too late to become wise; but if the change comes late, there is always more difficulty in starting a reform.',
    'The question whether a science be possible, presupposes a doubt as to its actuality. But such a doubt offends the men whose whole possessions consist of this supposed jewel; hence he who raises the doubt must expect opposition from all sides. Some, in the proud consciousness of their possessions, which are ancient, and therefore considered legitimate, will take their metaphysical compendia in their hands, and look down on him with contempt; others, who never see anything except it be identical with what they have seen before, will not understand him, and everything will remain for a time, as if nothing had happened to excite the concern, or the hope, for an impending change.',
    'Nevertheless, I venture to predict that the independent reader of these Prolegomena will not only doubt his previous science, but ultimately be fully persuaded, that it cannot exist unless the demands here stated on which its possibility depends, be satisfied; and, as this has never been done, that there is, as yet, no such thing as Metaphysics. But as it can never cease to be in demand,5—since the interests of common sense are intimately interwoven with it, he must confess that a radical reform, or rather a new birth of the science after an original plan, are unavoidable, however men may struggle against it for a while.',
    'Since the Essays of Locke and Leibnitz, or rather since the origin of metaphysics so far as we know its history, nothing has ever happened which was more decisive to its fate than the attack made upon it by David Hume. He threw no light on this species of knowledge, but he certainly struck a spark from which light might have been obtained, had it caught some inflammable substance and had its smouldering fire been carefully nursed and developed.',
    'Hume started from a single but important concept in Metaphysics, viz., that of Cause and Effect (including its derivatives force and action, etc.). He challenges reason, which pretends to have given birth to this idea from herself, to answer him by what right she thinks anything to be so constituted, that if that thing be posited, something else also must necessarily be posited; for this is the meaning of the concept of cause. He demonstrated irrefutably that it was perfectly impossible for reason to think a priori and by means of concepts a combination involving necessity. We cannot at all see why, in consequence of the existence of one thing, another must necessarily exist, or how the concept of such a combination can arise a priori. Hence he inferred, that reason was altogether deluded with reference to this concept, which she erroneously considered as one of her children, whereas in reality it was nothing but a bastard of imagination, impregnated by experience, which subsumed certain representations under the Law of Association, and mistook the subjective necessity of habit for an objective necessity arising from insight. Hence he inferred that reason had no power to think such combinations, even generally, because her concepts would then be purely fictitious, and all her pretended a priori cognitions nothing but common experiences marked with a false stamp. In plain language there is not, and cannot be, any such thing as metaphysics at all.6',
    "However hasty and mistaken Hume's conclusion may appear, it was at least founded upon investigation, and this investigation deserved the concentrated attention of the brighter spirits of his day as well as determined efforts on their part to discover, if possible, a happier solution of the problem in the sense proposed by him, all of which would have speedily resulted in a complete reform of the science.",
    'But Hume suffered the usual misfortune of metaphysicians, of not being understood. It is positively painful to see how utterly his opponents, Reid, Oswald, Beattie, and lastly Priestley, missed the point of the problem; for while they were ever taking for granted that which he doubted, and demonstrating with zeal and often with impudence that which he never thought of doubting, they so misconstrued his valuable suggestion that everything remained in its old condition, as if nothing had happened.',
    "The question was not whether the concept of cause was right, useful, and even indispensable for our knowledge of nature, for this Hume had never doubted; but whether that concept could be thought by reason a priori, and consequently whether it possessed an inner truth, independent of all experience, implying a wider application than merely to the objects of experience. This was Hume's problem. It was a question concerning the origin, not concerning the indispensable need of the concept. Were the former decided, the conditions of the use and the sphere of its valid application would have been determined as a matter of course.",
    "But to satisfy the conditions of the problem, the opponents of the great thinker should have penetrated very deeply into the nature of reason, so far as it is concerned with pure thinking,—a task which did not suit them. They found a more convenient method of being defiant without any insight, viz., the appeal to common sense. It is indeed a great gift of God, to possess right, or (as they now call it) plain common sense. But this common sense must be shown practically, by well-considered and reasonable thoughts and words, not by appealing to it as an oracle, when no rational justification can be advanced. To appeal to common sense, when insight and science fail, and no sooner—this is one of the subtile discoveries of modern times, by means of which the most superficial ranter can safely enter the lists with the most thorough thinker, and hold his own. But as long as a particle of insight remains, no one would think of having recourse to this subterfuge. For what is it but an appeal to the opinion of the multitude, of whose applause the philosopher is ashamed, while the popular charlatan glories and confides in it? I should think that Hume might fairly have laid as much claim to common sense as Beattie, and in addition to a critical reason (such as the latter did not possess), which keeps common sense in check and prevents it from speculating, or, if speculations are under discussion, restrains the desire to decide because it cannot satisfy itself concerning its own arguments. By this means alone can common sense remain sound. Chisels and hammers may suffice to work a piece of wood, but for steel-engraving we require an engraver's needle. Thus common sense and speculative understanding are each serviceable in their own way, the former in judgments which apply immediately to experience, the latter when we judge universally from mere concepts, as in metaphysics, where sound common sense, so called in spite of the inapplicability of the word, has no right to judge at all.",
    'I openly confess, the suggestion of David Hume was the very thing, which many years ago first interrupted my dogmatic slumber, and gave my investigations in the field of speculative philosophy quite a new direction. I was far from following him in the conclusions at which he arrived by regarding, not the whole of his problem, but a part, which by itself can give us no information. If we start from a well-founded, but undeveloped, thought, which another has bequeathed to us, we may well hope by continued reflection to advance farther than the acute man, to whom we owe the first spark of light.',
    "I therefore first tried whether Hume's objection could not be put into a general form, and soon found that the concept of the connexion of cause and effect was by no means the only idea by which the understanding thinks the connexion of things a priori, but rather that metaphysics consists altogether of such connexions. I sought to ascertain their number, and when I had satisfactorily succeeded in this by starting from a single principle, I proceeded to the deduction of these concepts, which I was now certain were not deduced from experience, as Hume had apprehended, but sprang from the pure understanding. This deduction (which seemed impossible to my acute predecessor, which had never even occurred to any one else, though no one had hesitated to use the concepts without investigating the basis of their objective validity) was the most difficult task ever undertaken in the service of metaphysics; and the worst was that metaphysics, such as it then existed, could not assist me in the least, because this deduction alone can render metaphysics possible. But as soon as I had succeeded in solving Hume's problem not merely in a particular case, but with respect to the whole faculty of pure reason, I could proceed safely, though slowly, to determine the whole sphere of pure reason completely and from general principles, in its circumference as well as in its contents. This was required for metaphysics in order to construct its system according to a reliable method.",
    "But I fear that the execution of Hume's problem in its widest extent (viz., my Critique of the Pure Reason) will fare as the problem itself fared, when first proposed. It will be misjudged because it is misunderstood, and misunderstood because men choose to skim through the book, and not to think through it—a disagreeable task, because the work is dry, obscure, opposed to all ordinary notions, and moreover long-winded. I confess, however, I did not expect to hear from philosophers complaints of want of popularity, entertainment, and facility, when the existence of a highly prized and indispensable cognition is at stake, which cannot be established otherwise than by the strictest rules of methodic precision. Popularity may follow, but is inadmissible at the beginning. Yet as regards a certain obscurity, arising partly from the diffuseness of the plan, owing to which the principal points of the investigation are easily lost sight of, the complaint is just, and I intend to remove it by the present Prolegomena.",
    'The first-mentioned work, which discusses the pure faculty of reason in its whole compass and bounds, will remain the foundation, to which the Prolegomena, as a preliminary exercise, refer; for our critique must first be established as a complete and perfected science, before we can think of letting Metaphysics appear on the scene, or even have the most distant hope of attaining it.',
    "We have been long accustomed to seeing antiquated knowledge produced as new by taking it out of its former context, and reducing it to system in a new suit of any fancy pattern under new titles. Most readers will set out by expecting nothing else from the Critique; but these Prolegomena may persuade him that it is a perfectly new science, of which no one has ever even thought, the very idea of which was unknown, and for which nothing hitherto accomplished can be of the smallest use, except it be the suggestion of Hume's doubts. Yet ever, he did not suspect such a formal science, but ran his ship ashore, for safety's sake, landing on scepticism, there to let it lie and rot; whereas my object is rather to give it a pilot, who, by means of safe astronomical principles drawn from a knowledge of the globe, and provided with a complete chart and compass, may steer the ship safely, whither he listeth.",
    "If in a new science, which is wholly isolated and unique in its kind, we started with the prejudice that we can judge of things by means of our previously acquired knowledge, which is precisely what has first to be called in question, we should only fancy we saw everywhere what we had already known, the expressions, having a similar sound, only that all would appear utterly metamorphosed, senseless and unintelligible, because we should have as a foundation our own notions, made by long habit a second nature, instead of the author's. But the longwindedness of the work, so far as it depends on the subject, and not the exposition, its consequent unavoidable dryness and its scholastic precision are qualities which can only benefit the science, though they may discredit the book.",
    'Few writers are gifted with the subtilty, and at the same time with the grace, of David Hume, or with the depth, as well as the elegance, of Moses Mendelssohn. Yet I flatter myself I might have made my own exposition popular, had my object been merely to sketch out a plan and leave its completion to others, instead of having my heart in the welfare of the science, to which I had devoted myself so long; in truth, it required no little constancy, and even self-denial, to postpone the sweets of an immediate success to the prospect of a slower, but more lasting, reputation.',
    'Making plans is often the occupation of an opulent and boastful mind, which thus obtains the reputation of a creative genius, by demanding what it cannot itself supply; by censuring, what it cannot improve; and by proposing, what it knows not where to find. And yet something more should belong to a sound plan of a general critique of pure reason than mere conjectures, if this plan is to be other than the usual declamations of pious aspirations. But pure reason is a sphere so separate and self-contained, that we cannot touch a part without affecting all the rest. We can therefore do nothing without first determining the position of each part, and its relation to the rest; for, as our judgment cannot be corrected by anything without, the validity and use of every part depends upon the relation in which it stands to all the rest within the domain of reason.',
    'So in the structure of an organized body, the end of each member can only be deduced from the full conception of the whole. It may, then, be said of such a critique that it is never trustworthy except it be perfectly complete, down to the smallest elements of pure reason. In the sphere of this faculty you can determine either everything or nothing.',
    'But although a mere sketch, preceding the Critique of Pure Reason, would be unintelligible, unreliable, and useless, it is all the more useful as a sequel. For so we are able to grasp the whole, to examine in detail the chief points of importance in the science, and to improve in many respects our exposition, as compared with the first execution of the work.',
    'After the completion of the work I offer here such a plan which is sketched out after an analytical method, while the work itself had to be executed in the synthetical style, in order that the science may present all its articulations, as the structure of a peculiar cognitive faculty, in their natural combination. But should any reader find this plan, which I publish as the Prolegomena to any future Metaphysics, still obscure, let him consider that not every one is bound to study Metaphysics, that many minds will succeed very well, in the exact and even in deep sciences, more closely allied to practical experience,7 while they cannot succeed in investigations dealing exclusively with abstract concepts. In such cases men should apply their talents to other subjects. But he who undertakes to judge, or still more, to construct, a system of Metaphysics, must satisfy the demands here made, either by adopting my solution, or by thoroughly refuting it, and substituting another. To evade it is impossible.',
    'In conclusion, let it be remembered that this much-abused obscurity (frequently serving as a mere pretext under which people hide their own indolence or dullness) has its uses, since all who in other sciences observe a judicious silence, speak authoritatively in metaphysics and make bold decisions, because their ignorance is not here contrasted with the knowledge of others. Yet it does contrast with sound critical principles, which we may therefore commend in the words of Virgil:',
    '"Ignavum, fucos, pecus a praesepibus arcent."',
    '"Bees are defending their hives against drones, those indolent creatures."',
    'PROLEGOMENA.',
    'PREAMBLE ON THE PECULIARITIES OF ALL METAPHYSICAL COGNITION.',
    '§ 1.  Of the Sources of Metaphysics.',
    'IF it becomes desirable to formulate any cognition as science, it will be necessary first to determine accurately those peculiar features which no other science has in common with it, constituting its characteristics; otherwise the boundaries of all sciences become confused, and none of them can be treated thoroughly according to its nature.',
    'The characteristics of a science may consist of a simple difference of object, or of the sources of cognition, or of the kind of cognition, or perhaps of all three conjointly. On this, therefore, depends the idea of a possible science and its territory.',
    'First, as concerns the sources of metaphysical cognition, its very concept implies that they cannot be empirical. Its principles (including not only its maxims but its basic notions) must never be derived from experience. It must not be physical but metaphysical knowledge, viz., knowledge lying beyond experience. It can therefore have for its basis neither external experience, which is the source of physics proper, nor internal, which is the basis of empirical psychology. It is therefore a priori knowledge, coming from pure Understanding and pure Reason.',
    'But so far Metaphysics would not be distinguish able from pure Mathematics; it must therefore be called pure philosophical cognition; and for the meaning of this term I refer to the Critique of the Pure Reason (II. "Method of Transcendentalism," Chap. I., Sec. i), where the distinction between these two employments of the reason is sufficiently explained. So far concerning the sources of metaphysical cognition.',
    '§ 2.  Concerning the Kind of Cognition which can alone be called Metaphysical.',
    'a.  Of the Distinction between Analytical and Synthetical Judgments in general.—The peculiarity of its sources demands that metaphysical cognition must consist of nothing but a priori judgments. But whatever be their origin, or their logical form, there is a distinction in judgments, as to their content, according to which they are either merely explicative, adding nothing to the content of the cognition, or expansive, increasing the given cognition: the former may be called analytical, the latter synthetical, judgments.',
    'Analytical judgments express nothing in the predicate but what has been already actually thought in the concept of the subject, though not so distinctly or with the same (full) consciousness. When I say: All bodies are extended, I have not amplified in the least my concept of body, but have only analysed it, as extension was really thought to belong to that concept before the judgment was made, though it was not expressed; this judgment is therefore analytical. On the contrary, this judgment, All bodies have weight, contains in its predicate something not actually thought in the general concept of the body; it amplifies my knowledge by adding something to my concept, and must therefore be called synthetical.',
    'b.  The Common Principle of all Analytical Judgments is the Law of Contradiction.—All analytical judgments depend wholly on the law of Contradiction, and are in their nature a priori cognitions, whether the concepts that supply them with matter be empirical or not. For the predicate of an affirmative analytical judgment is already contained in the concept of the subject, of which it cannot be denied without contradiction. In the same way its opposite is necessarily denied of the subject in an analytical, but negative, judgment, by the same law of contradiction. Such is the nature of the judgments: all bodies are extended, and no bodies are unextended (i.e., simple).',
    'For this very reason all analytical judgments are a priori even when the concepts are empirical, as, for example, Gold is a yellow metal; for to know this I require no experience beyond my concept of gold as a yellow metal: it is, in fact, the very concept, and I need only analyse it, without looking beyond it elsewhere.',
    'c.  Synthetical Judgments require a different Principle from the Law of Contradiction.—There are synthetical a posteriori judgments of empirical origin; but there are also others which are proved to be certain a priori, and which spring from pure Understanding and Reason. Yet they both agree in this, that they cannot possibly spring from the principle of analysis, viz., the law of contradiction, alone; they require a quite different principle, though, from whatever they may be deduced, they must be subject to the law of contradiction, which must never be violated, even though everything cannot be deduced from it. I shall first classify synthetical judgments.',
    '1.  Empirical Judgments are always synthetical. For it would be absurd to base an analytical judgment on experience, as our concept suffices for the purpose without requiring any testimony from experience. That body is extended, is a judgment established a priori, and not an empirical judgment. For before appealing to experience, we already have all the conditions of the judgment in the concept, from which we have but to elicit the predicate according to the law of contradiction, and thereby to become conscious of the necessity of the judgment, which experience could not even teach us.',
    '2.  Mathematical Judgments are all synthetical. This fact seems hitherto to have altogether escaped the observation of those who have analysed human reason; it even seems directly opposed to all their conjectures, though incontestably certain, and most important in its consequences. For as it was found that the conclusions of mathematicians all proceed according to the law of contradiction (as is demanded by all apodeictic certainty), men persuaded themselves that the fundamental principles were known from the same law. This was a great mistake, for a synthetical proposition can indeed be comprehended according to the law of contradiction, but only by presupposing another synthetical proposition from which it follows, but never in itself.',
    'First of all, we must observe that all proper mathematical judgments are a priori, and not empirical, because they carry with them necessity, which cannot be obtained from experience. But if this be not conceded to me, very good; I shall confine my assertion to pure Mathematics, the very notion of which implies that it contains pure a priori and not empirical cognitions.',
    'It might at first be thought that the proposition 7 + 5 = 12 is a mere analytical judgment, following from the concept of the sum of seven and five, according to the law of contradiction. But on closer examination it appears that the concept of the sum of 7 + 5 contains merely their union in a single number, without its being at all thought what the particular number is that unites them. The concept of twelve is by no means thought by merely thinking of the combination of seven and five; and analyse this possible sum as we may, we shall not discover twelve in the concept. We must go beyond these concepts, by calling to our aid some concrete image (Anschauung), i.e., either our five fingers, or five points (as Segner has it in his Arithmetic), and we must add successively the units of the five, given in some concrete image (Anschauung), to the concept of seven. Hence our concept is really amplified by the proposition 7 + 5 = 12, and we add to the first a second, not thought in it. Arithmetical judgments are therefore synthetical, and the more plainly according as we take larger numbers; for in such cases it is clear that, however closely we analyse our concepts without calling visual images (Anschauung) to our aid, we can never find the sum by such mere dissection.',
    'All principles of geometry are no less analytical. That a straight line is the shortest path between two points, is a synthetical proposition. For my concept of straight contains nothing of quantity, but only a quality. The attribute of shortness is therefore altogether additional, and cannot be obtained by any analysis of the concept. Here, too, visualisation (Anschauung) must come to aid us. It alone makes the synthesis possible.',
    'Some other principles, assumed by geometers, are indeed actually analytical, and depend on the law of contradiction; but they only serve, as identical propositions, as a method of concatenation, and not as principles, e.g., a = a, the whole is equal to itself, or a + b > a, the whole is greater than its part. And yet even these, though they are recognised as valid from mere concepts, are only admitted in mathematics, because they can be represented in some visual form (Anschauung). What usually makes us believe that the predicate of such apodeictic8 judgments is already contained in our concept, and that the judgment is therefore analytical, is the duplicity of the expression, requesting us to think a certain predicate as of necessity implied in the thought of a given concept, which necessity attaches to the concept. But the question is not what we are requested to join in thought to the given concept, but what we actually think together with and in it, though obscurely; and so it appears that the predicate belongs to these concepts necessarily indeed, yet not directly but indirectly by an added visualisation (Anschauung).',
    '§ 3.  A Remark on the General Division of Judgments into Analytical and Synthetical.',
    'This division is indispensable, as concerns the Critique of human understanding, and therefore deserves to be called classical, though otherwise it is of little use, but this is the reason why dogmatic philosophers, who always seek the sources of metaphysical judgments in Metaphysics itself, and not apart from it, in the pure laws of reason generally, altogether neglected this apparently obvious distinction. Thus the celebrated Wolf, and his acute follower Baumgarten, came to seek the proof of the principle of Sufficient Reason, which is clearly synthetical, in the principle of Contradiction. In Locke\'s Essay, however, I find an indication of my division. For in the fourth book (chap. iii. § 9, seq.), having discussed the various connexions of representations in judgments, and their sources, one of which he makes "identity and contradiction" (analytical judgments), and another the coexistence of representations in a subject, he confesses (§ 10) that our a priori knowledge of the latter is very narrow, and almost nothing. But in his remarks on this species of cognition, there is so little of what is definite, and reduced to rules, that we cannot wonder if no one, not even Hume, was led to make investigations concerning this sort of judgments. For such general and yet definite principles are not easily learned from other men, who have had them obscurely in their minds. We must hit on them first by our own reflexion, then we find them elsewhere, where we could not possibly have found them at first, because the authors themselves did not know that such an idea lay at the basis of their observations. Men who never think independently have nevertheless the acuteness to discover everything, after it has been once shown them, in what was said long since, though no one ever saw it there before.',
    '§ 4.  The General Question of the Prolegomena.—Is Metaphysics at all Possible?',
    'Were a metaphysics, which could maintain its place as a science, really in existence; could we say, here is metaphysics, learn it, and it will convince you irresistibly and irrevocably of its truth: this question would be useless, and there would only remain that other question (which would rather be a test of our acuteness, than a proof of the existence of the thing itself), "How is the science possible, and how does reason come to attain it?" But human reason has not been so fortunate in this case. There is no single book to which you can point as you do to Euclid, and say: This is Metaphysics; here you may find the noblest objects of this science, the knowledge of a highest Being, and of a future existence, proved from principles of pure reason. We can be shown indeed many judgments, demonstrably certain, and never questioned; but these are all analytical, and rather concern the materials and the scaffolding for Metaphysics, than the extension of knowledge, which is our proper object in studying it (§ 2). Even supposing you produce synthetical judgments (such as the law of Sufficient Reason, which you have never proved, as you ought to, from pure reason a priori, though we gladly concede its truth), you lapse when they come to be employed for your principal object, into such doubtful assertions, that in all ages one Metaphysics has contradicted another, either in its assertions, or their proofs, and thus has itself destroyed its own claim to lasting assent. Nay, the very attempts to set up such a science are the main cause of the early appearance of scepticism, a mental attitude in which reason treats itself with such violence that it could never have arisen save from complete despair of ever satisfying our most important aspirations. For long before men began to inquire into nature methodically, they consulted abstract reason, which had to some extent been exercised by means of ordinary experience; for reason is ever present, while laws of nature must usually be discovered with labor. So Metaphysics floated to the surface, like foam, which dissolved the moment it was scooped off. But immediately there appeared a new supply on the surface, to be ever eagerly gathered up by some, while others, instead of seeking in the depths the cause of the phenomenon, thought they showed their wisdom by ridiculing the idle labor of their neighbors.',
    'The essential and distinguishing feature of pure mathematical cognition among all other a priori cognitions is, that it cannot at all proceed from concepts, but only by means of the construction of concepts (see Critique II., Method of Transcendentalism, chap. I., sect. 1). As therefore in its judgments it must proceed beyond the concept to that which its corresponding visualisation (Anschauung) contains, these judgments neither can, nor ought to, arise analytically, by dissecting the concept, but are all synthetical.',
    "I cannot refrain from pointing out the disadvantage resulting to philosophy from the neglect of this easy and apparently insignificant observation. Hume being prompted (a task worthy of a philosopher) to cast his eye over the whole field of a priori cognitions in which human understanding claims such mighty possessions, heedlessly severed from it a whole, and indeed its most valuable, province, viz., pure mathematics; for he thought its nature, or, so to speak, the state-constitution of this empire, depended on totally different principles, namely, on the law of contradiction alone; and although he did not divide Judgments in this manner formally and universally as I have done here, what he said was equivalent to this: that mathematics contains only analytical, but metaphysics synthetical, a priori judgments. In this, however, he was greatly mistaken, and the mistake had a decidedly injurious effect upon his whole conception. But for this, he would have extended his question concerning the origin of our synthetical judgments far beyond the metaphysical concept of Causality, and included in it the possibility of mathematics a priori also, for this latter he must have assumed to be equally synthetical. And then he could not have based his metaphysical judgments on mere experience without subjecting the axioms of mathematics equally to experience, a thing which he was far too acute to do. The good company into which metaphysics would thus have been brought, would have saved it from the danger of a contemptuous ill-treatment, for the thrust intended for it must have reached mathematics, which was not and could not have been Hume's intention. Thus that acute man would have been led into considerations which must needs be similar to those that now occupy us, but which would have gained inestimably by his inimitably elegant style.",
    'Metaphysical judgments, properly so called, are all synthetical. We must distinguish judgments pertaining to metaphysics from metaphysical judgments properly so called. Many of the former are analytical, but they only afford the means for metaphysical judgments, which are the whole end of the science, and which are always synthetical. For if there be concepts pertaining to metaphysics (as, for example, that of substance), the judgments springing from simple analysis of them also pertain to metaphysics, as, for example, substance is that which only exists as subject; and by means of several such analytical judgments, we seek to approach the definition of the concept. But as the analysis of a pure concept of the understanding pertaining to metaphysics, does not proceed in any different manner from the dissection of any other, even empirical, concepts, not pertaining to metaphysics (such as: air is an elastic fluid, the elasticity of which is not destroyed by any known degree of cold), it follows that the concept indeed, but not the analytical judgment, is properly metaphysical. This science has something peculiar in the production of its a priori cognitions, which must therefore be distinguished from the features it has in common with other rational knowledge. Thus the judgment, that all the substance in things is permanent, is a synthetical and properly metaphysical judgment.',
    'If the a priori principles, which constitute the materials of metaphysics, have first been collected according to fixed principles, then their analysis will be of great value; it might be taught as a particular part (as a philosophia definitiva), containing nothing but analytical judgments pertaining to metaphysics, and could be treated separately from the synthetical which constitute metaphysics proper. For indeed these analyses are not elsewhere of much value, except in metaphysics, i.e., as regards the synthetical judgments, which are to be generated by these previously analysed concepts.',
    'The conclusion drawn in this section then is, that metaphysics is properly concerned with synethetical propositions a priori, and these alone constitute its end, for which it indeed requires various dissections of its concepts, viz., of its analytical judgments, but wherein the procedure is not different from that in every other kind of knowledge, in which we merely seek to render our concepts distinct by analysis. But the generation of a priori cognition by concrete images as well as by concepts, in fine of synthetical propositions a priori in philosophical cognition, constitutes the essential subject of Metaphysics.',
    'Weary therefore as well of dogmatism, which teaches us nothing, as of scepticism, which does not even promise us anything, not even the quiet state of a contented ignorance; disquieted by the importance of knowledge so much needed; and lastly, rendered suspicious by long experience of all knowledge which we believe we possess, or which offers itself, under the title of pure reason: there remains but one critical question on the answer to which our future procedure depends, viz., Is Metaphysics at all possible? But this question must be answered not by sceptical objections to the asseverations of some actual system of metaphysics (for we do not as yet admit such a thing to exist), but from the conception, as yet only problematical, of a science of this sort.',
    'In the Critique of Pure Reason I have treated this question synthetically, by making inquiries into pure reason itself, and endeavoring in this source to determine the elements as well as the laws of its pure use according to principles. The task is difficult, and requires a resolute reader to penetrate by degrees into a system, based on no data except reason itself, and which therefore seeks, without resting upon any fact, to unfold knowledge from its original germs. Prolegomena, however, are designed for preparatory exercises; they are intended rather to point out what we have to do in order if possible to actualise a science, than to propound it. They must therefore rest upon something already known as trustworthy, from which we can set out with confidence, and ascend to sources as yet unknown, the discovery of which will not only explain to us what we knew, but exhibit a sphere of many cognitions which all spring from the same sources. The method of Prolegomena, especially of those designed as a preparation for future metaphysics, is consequently analytical.',
    'But it happens fortunately, that though we cannot assume metaphysics to be an actual science, we can say with confidence that certain pure a priori synthetical cognitions, pure Mathematics and pure Physics are actual and given; for both contain propositions, which are thoroughly recognised as apodeictically certain, partly by mere reason, partly by general consent arising from experience, and yet as independent of experience. We have therefore some at least uncontested synthetical knowledge a priori, and need not ask whether it be possible, for it is actual, but how it is possible, in order that we may deduce from the principle which makes the given cognitions possible the possibility of all the rest.',
    'The General Problem: How is Cognition from Pure Reason Possible?',
    '§ 5.  We have above learned the significant distinction between analytical and synthetical judgments. The possibility of analytical propositions was easily comprehended, being entirely founded on the law of Contradiction. The possibility of synthetical a posteriori judgments, of those which are gathered from experience, also requires no particular explanation; for experience is nothing but a continual synthesis of perceptions. There remain therefore only synthetical propositions a priori, of which the possibility must be sought or investigated, because they must depend upon other principles than the law of contradiction.',
    'But here we need not first establish the possibility of such propositions so as to ask whether they are possible. For there are enough of them which indeed are of undoubted certainty, and as our present method is analytical, we shall start from the fact, that such synthetical but purely rational cognition actually exists; but we must now inquire into the reason of this possibility, and ask, how such cognition is possible, in order that we may from the principles of its possibility be enabled to determine the conditions of its use, its sphere and its limits. The proper problem upon which all depends, when expressed with scholastic precision, is therefore:',
    'How are Synthetic Propositions a priori possible?',
    'For the sake of popularity I have above expressed this problem somewhat differently, as an inquiry into purely rational cognition, which I could do for once without detriment to the desired comprehension, because, as we have only to do here with metaphysics and its sources, the reader will, I hope, after the fore going remarks, keep in mind that when we speak of purely rational cognition, we do not mean analytical, but synthetical cognition.9',
    'Metaphysics stands or falls with the solution of this problem: its very existence depends upon it. Let any one make metaphysical assertions with ever so much plausibility, let him overwhelm us with conclusions, if he has not previously proved able to answer this question satisfactorily, I have a right to say: this is all vain baseless philosophy and false wisdom. You speak through pure reason, and claim, as it were to create cognitions a priori by not only dissecting given concepts, but also by asserting connexions which do not rest upon the law of contradiction, and which you believe you conceive quite independently of all experience; how do you arrive at this, and how will you justify your pretensions? An appeal to the consent of the common sense of mankind cannot be allowed; for that is a witness whose authority depends merely upon rumor. Says Horace:',
    '"Quodcunque ostendis mihi sic, incredulus odi."',
    '"To all that which thou provest me thus, I refuse to give credence."',
    'The answer to this question, though indispensable, is difficult; and though the principal reason that it was not made long ago is, that the possibility of the question never occurred to anybody, there is yet another reason, which is this that a satisfactory answer to this one question requires a much more persistent, profound, and painstaking reflexion, than the most diffuse work on Metaphysics, which on its first appearance promised immortality to its author. And every intelligent reader, when he carefully reflects what this problem requires, must at first be struck with its difficulty, and would regard it as insoluble and even impossible, did there not actually exist pure synthetical cognitions a priori. This actually happened to David Hume, though he did not conceive the question in its entire universality as is done here, and as must be done, should the answer be decisive for all Metaphysics. For how is it possible, says that acute man, that when a concept is given me, I can go beyond it and connect with it another, which is not contained in it, in such a manner as if the latter necessarily belonged to the former? Nothing but experience can furnish us with such connexions (thus he concluded from the difficulty which he took to be an impossibility), and all that vaunted necessity, or, what is the same thing, all cognition assumed to be a priori, is nothing but a long habit of accepting something as true, and hence of mistaking subjective necessity for objective.',
    'Should my reader complain of the difficulty and the trouble which I occasion him in the solution of this problem, he is at liberty to solve it himself in an easier way. Perhaps he will then feel under obligation to the person who has undertaken for him a labor of so profound research, and will rather be surprised at the facility with which, considering the nature of the subject, the solution has been attained. Yet it has cost years of work to solve the problem in its whole universality (using the term in the mathematical sense, viz., for that which is sufficient for all cases), and finally to exhibit it in the analytical form, as the reader finds it here.',
    'All metaphysicians are therefore solemnly and legally suspended from their occupations till they shall have answered in a satisfactory manner the question, "How are synthetic cognitions a priori possible?" For the answer contains which they must show when they have anything to offer in the name of pure reason. But if they do not possess these credentials, they can expect nothing else of reasonable people, who have been deceived so often, than to be dismissed without further ado.',
    'If they on the other hand desire to carry on their business, not as a science, but as an art of wholesome oratory suited to the common sense of man, they cannot in justice be prevented. They will then speak the modest language of a rational belief, they will grant that they are not allowed even to conjecture, far less to know, anything which lies beyond the bounds of all possible experience, but only to assume (not for speculative use, which they must abandon, but for practical purposes only) the existence of something that is possible and even indispensable for the guidance of the understanding and of the will in life. In this manner alone can they be called useful and wise men, and the more so as they renounce the title of metaphysicians; for the latter profess to be speculative philosophers, and since, when judgments a priori are under discussion, poor probabilities cannot be admitted (for what is declared to be known a priori is thereby announced as necessary), such men cannot be permitted to play with conjectures, but their assertions must be either science, or are worth nothing at all.',
    'It may be said, that the entire transcendental philosophy, which necessarily precedes all metaphysics, is nothing but the complete solution of the problem here propounded, in systematical order and completeness, and hitherto we have never had any transcendental philosophy; for what goes by its name is properly a part of metaphysics, whereas the former science is intended first to constitute the possibility of the latter, and must therefore precede all metaphysics. And it is not surprising that when a whole science, deprived of all help from other sciences, and consequently in itself quite new, is required to answer a single question satisfactorily, we should find the answer troublesome and difficult, nay even shrouded in obscurity.',
    'As we now proceed to this solution according to the analytical method, in which we assume that such cognitions from pure reasons actually exist, we can only appeal to two sciences of theoretical cognition (which alone is under consideration here), pure mathematics and pure natural science (physics). For these alone can exhibit to us objects in a definite and actualisable form (in der Anschauung), and consequently (if there should occur in them a cognition a priori) can show the truth or conformity of the cognition to the object in concreto, that is, its actuality, from which we could proceed to the reason of its possibility by the analytic method. This facilitates our work greatly for here universal considerations are not only applied to facts, but even start from them, while in a synthetic procedure they must strictly be derived in abstracto from concepts.',
    'But, in order to rise from these actual and at the same time well-grounded pure cognitions a priori to such a possible cognition of the same as we are seeking, viz., to metaphysics as a science, we must comprehend that which occasions it, I mean the mere natural, though in spite of its truth not unsuspected, cognition a priori which lies at the bottom of that science, the elaboration of which without any critical investigation of its possibility is commonly called metaphysics. In a word, we must comprehend the natural conditions of such a science as a part of our inquiry, and thus the transcendental problem will be gradually answered by a division into four questions:',
    '1.  How is pure mathematics possible?',
    '2.  How is pure natural science possible?',
    '3.  How is metaphysics in general possible?',
    '4.  How is metaphysics as a science possible?',
    'It may be seen that the solution of these problems, though chiefly designed to exhibit the essential matter of the Critique, has yet something peculiar, which for itself alone deserves attention. This is the search for the sources of given sciences in reason itself, so that its faculty of knowing something a priori may by its own deeds be investigated and measured. By this procedure these sciences gain, if not with regard to their contents, yet as to their proper use, and while they throw light on the higher question concerning their common origin, they give, at the same time, an occasion better to explain their own nature.',
    'FIRST PART OF THE TRANSCENDENTAL PROBLEM.',
    'HOW IS PURE MATHEMATICS POSSIBLE?',
    '§ 6.',
    'HERE is a great and established branch of knowledge, encompassing even now a wonderfully large domain and promising an unlimited extension in the future. Yet it carries with it thoroughly apodeictical certainty, i.e., absolute necessity, which therefore rests upon no empirical grounds. Consequently it is a pure product of reason, and moreover is thoroughly synthetical. [Here the question arises:]',
    '"How then is it possible for human reason to produce a cognition of this nature entirely a priori?"',
    'Does not this faculty [which produces mathematics], as it neither is nor can be based upon experience, presuppose some ground of cognition a priori, which lies deeply hidden, but which might reveal itself by these its effects, if their first beginnings were but diligently ferreted out?',
    '§ 7.  But we find that all mathematical cognition has this peculiarity: it must first exhibit its concept in a visual form (Anschauung) and indeed a priori, therefore in a visual form which is not empirical, but pure. Without this mathematics cannot take a single step; hence its judgments are always visual, viz., "intuitive"; whereas philosophy must be satisfied with discursive judgments from mere concepts, and though it may illustrate its doctrines through a visual figure, can never derive them from it. This observation on the nature of mathematics gives us a clue to the first and highest condition of its possibility, which is, that some non-sensuous visualisation (called pure intuition, or reine Anschauung) must form its basis, in which all its concepts can be exhibited or constructed, in concreto and yet a priori. If we can find out this pure intuition and its possibility, we may thence easily explain how synthetical propositions a priori are possible in pure mathematics, and consequently how this science itself is possible. Empirical intuition [viz., sense-perception] enables us without difficulty to enlarge the concept which we frame of an object of intuition [or sense-perception], by new predicates, which intuition [i.e., sense-perception] itself presents synthetically in experience. Pure intuition [viz., the visualisation of forms in our imagination, from which every thing sensual, i.e., every thought of material qualities, is excluded] does so likewise, only with this difference, that in the latter case the synthetical judgment is a priori certain and apodeictical, in the former, only a posteriori and empirically certain; because this latter contains only that which occurs in contingent empirical intuition, but the former, that which must necessarily be discovered in pure intuition. Here intuition, being an intuition a priori, is before all experience, viz., before any perception of particular objects, inseparably conjoined with its concept.',
    '§ 8.  But with this step our perplexity seems rather to increase than to lessen. For the question now is, "How is it possible to intuite [in a visual form] anything a priori?" An intuition [viz., a visual sense-perception] is such a representation as immediately depends upon the presence of the object. Hence it seems impossible to intuite from the outset a priori, because intuition would in that event take place without either a former or a present object to refer to, and by consequence could not be intuition. Concepts indeed are such, that we can easily form some of them a priori, viz., such as contain nothing but the thought of an object in general; and we need not find ourselves in an immediate relation to the object. Take, for instance, the concepts of Quantity, of Cause, etc. But even these require, in order to make them under stood, a certain concrete use—that is, an application to some sense-experience (Anschauung), by which an object of them is given us. But how can the intuition of the object [its visualisation] precede the object itself?',
    '§ 9.  If our intuition [i.e., our sense-experience] were perforce of such a nature as to represent things as they are in themselves, there would not be any intuition a priori, but intuition would be always empirical. For I can only know what is contained in the object in itself when it is present and given to me. It is indeed even then incomprehensible how the visualising (Anschauung) of a present thing should make me know this thing as it is in itself, as its properties cannot migrate into my faculty of representation. But even granting this possibility, a visualising of that sort would not take place a priori, that is, before the object were presented to me; for without this latter fact no reason of a relation between my representation and the object can be imagined, unless it depend upon a direct inspiration.',
    'Therefore in one way only can my intuition (Anschauung) anticipate the actuality of the object, and be a cognition a priori, viz.: if my intuition contains nothing but the form of sensibility, antedating in my subjectivity all the actual impressions through which I am affected by objects.',
    'For that objects of sense can only be intuited according to this form of sensibility I can know a priori.  Hence it follows: that propositions, which concern this form of sensuous intuition only, are possible and valid for objects of the senses; as also, conversely, that intuitions which are possible a priori can never concern any other things than objects of our senses.10',
    '§ 10.  Accordingly, it is only the form of the sensuous intuition by which we can intuite things a priori, but by which we can know objects only as they appear to us (to our senses), not as they are in themselves; and this assumption is absolutely necessary if synthetical propositions a priori be granted as possible, or if, in case they actually occur, their possibility is to be comprehended and determined beforehand.',
    'Now, the intuitions which pure mathematics lays at the foundation of all its cognitions and judgments which appear at once apodeictic and necessary are Space and Time. For mathematics must first have all its concepts in intuition, and pure mathematics in pure intuition, that is, it must construct them. If it proceeded in any other way, it would be impossible to make any headway, for mathematics proceeds, not analytically by dissection of concepts, but synthetically, and if pure intuition be wanting, there is nothing in which the matter for synthetical judgments a priori can be given. Geometry is based upon the pure intuition of space. Arithmetic accomplishes its concept of number by the successive addition of units in time; and pure mechanics especially cannot attain its concepts of motion without employing the representation of time. Both representations, however, are only intuitions; for if we omit from the empirical intuitions of bodies and their alterations (motion) everything empirical, or belonging to sensation, space and time still remain, which are therefore pure intuitions that lie a priori at the basis of the empirical. Hence they can never be omitted, but at the same time, by their being pure intuitions a priori, they prove that they are mere forms of our sensibility, which must precede all empirical intuition, or perception of actual objects, and conformably to which objects can be known a priori, but only as they appear to us.',
    '§ 11.  The problem of the present section is therefore solved. Pure mathematics, as synthetical cognition a priori, is only possible by referring to no other objects than those of the senses. At the basis of their empirical intuition lies a pure intuition (of space and of time) which is a priori. This is possible, because the latter intuition is nothing but the mere form of sensibility, which precedes the actual appearance of the objects, in that it, in fact, makes them possible. Yet this faculty of intuiting a priori affects not the matter of the phenomenon (that is, the sense-element in it, for this constitutes that which is empirical), but its form, viz., space and time. Should any man venture to doubt that these are determinations adhering not to things in themselves, but to their relation to our sensibility, I should be glad to know how it can be possible to know the constitution of things a priori, viz., before we have any acquaintance with them and before they are presented to us. Such, however, is the case with space and time. But this is quite comprehensible as soon as both count for nothing more than formal conditions of our sensibility, while the objects count merely as phenomena; for then the form of the phenomenon, i.e., pure intuition, can by all means be represented as proceeding from ourselves, that is, a priori.',
    '§ 12.  In order to add something by way of illustration and confirmation, we need only watch the ordinary and necessary procedure of geometers. All proofs of the complete congruence of two given figures (where the one can in every respect be substituted for the other) come ultimately to this that they may be made to coincide; which is evidently nothing else than a synthetical proposition resting upon immediate intuition, and this intuition must be pure, or given a priori, otherwise the proposition could not rank as apodeictically certain, but would have empirical certainty only. In that case, it could only be said that it is always found to be so, and holds good only as far as our perception reaches. That everywhere space (which [in its entirety] is itself no longer the boundary of another space) has three dimensions, and that space cannot in any way have more, is based on the proposition that not more than three lines can intersect at right angles in one point; but this proposition cannot by any means be shown from concepts, but rests immediately on intuition, and indeed on pure and a priori intuition, because it is apodeictically certain. That we can require a line to be drawn to infinity (in indefinitum), or that a series of changes (for example, spaces traversed by motion) shall be infinitely continued, presupposes a representation of space and time, which can only attach to intuition, namely, so far as it in itself is bounded by nothing, for from concepts it could never be inferred. Consequently, the basis of mathematics actually are pure intuitions, which make its synthetical and apodeictically valid propositions possible. Hence our transcendental deduction of the notions of space and of time explains at the same time the possibility of pure mathematics. Without some such deduction its truth may be granted, but its existence could by no means be understood, and we must assume "that everything which can be given to our senses (to the external senses in space, to the internal one in time) is intuited by us as it appears to us, not as it is in itself."',
    '§ 13.  Those who cannot yet rid themselves of the notion that space and time are actual qualities inhering in things in themselves, may exercise their acumen on the following paradox. When they have in vain attempted its solution, and are free from prejudices at least for a few moments, they will suspect that the degradation of space and of time to mere forms of our sensuous intuition may perhaps be well founded.',
    'If two things are quite equal in all respects as much as can be ascertained by all means possible, quantitatively and qualitatively, it must follow, that the one can in all cases and under all circumstances replace the other, and this substitution would not occasion the least perceptible difference. This in fact is true of plane figures in geometry; but some spherical figures exhibit, notwithstanding a complete internal agreement, such a contrast in their external relation, that the one figure cannot possibly be put in the place of the other. For instance, two spherical triangles on opposite hemispheres, which have an arc of the equator as their common base, may be quite equal, both as regards sides and angles, so that nothing is to be found in either, if it be described for itself alone and completed, that would not equally be applicable to both; and yet the one cannot be put in the place of the other (being situated upon the opposite hemisphere). Here then is an internal difference between the two triangles, which difference our understanding cannot describe as internal, and which only manifests itself by external relations in space.',
    'But I shall adduce examples, taken from common life, that are more obvious still.',
    'What can be more similar in every respect and in every part more alike to my hand and to my ear, than their images in a mirror? And yet I cannot put such a hand as is seen in the glass in the place of its archetype; for if this is a right hand, that in the glass is a left one, and the image or reflexion of the right ear is a left one which never can serve as a substitute for the other. There are in this case no internal differences which our understanding could determine by thinking alone. Yet the differences are internal as the senses teach, for, notwithstanding their complete equality and similarity, the left hand cannot be enclosed in the same bounds as the right one (they are not congruent); the glove of one hand cannot be used for the other. What is the solution? These objects are not representations of things as they are in themselves, and as the pure understanding would cognise them, but sensuous intuitions, that is, appearances, the possibility of which rests upon the relation of certain things unknown in themselves to something else, viz., to our sensibility. Space is the form of the external intuition of this sensibility, and the internal determination of every space is only possible by the determination of its external relation to the whole space, of which it is a part (in other words, by its relation to the external sense). That is to say, the part is only possible through the whole, which is never the case with things in themselves, as objects of the mere understanding, but with appearances only. Hence the difference between similar and equal things, which are yet not congruent (for instance, two symmetric helices), cannot be made intelligible by any concept, but only by the relation to the right and the left hands which immediately refers to intuition.',
    'Remark I.',
    'Pure Mathematics, and especially pure geometry, can only have objective reality on condition that they refer to objects of sense. But in regard to the latter the principle holds good, that our sense representation is not a representation of things in themselves, but of the way in which they appear to us. Hence it follows, that the propositions of geometry are not the results of a mere creation of our poetic imagination, and that therefore they cannot be referred with assurance to actual objects; but rather that they are necessarily valid of space, and consequently of all that may be found in space, because space is nothing else than the form of all external appearances, and it is this form alone in which objects of sense can be given. Sensibility, the form of which is the basis of geometry, is that upon which the possibility of external appearance depends. Therefore these appearances can never contain anything but what geometry prescribes to them.',
    'It would be quite otherwise if the senses were so constituted as to represent objects as they are in themselves. For then it would not by any means follow from the conception of space, which with all its properties serves to the geometer as an a priori foundation, together with what is thence inferred, must be so in nature. The space of the geometer would be considered a mere fiction, and it would not be credited with objective validity, because we cannot see how things must of necessity agree with an image of them, which we make spontaneously and previous to our acquaintance with them. But if this image, or rather this formal intuition, is the essential property of our sensibility, by means of which alone objects are given to us, and if this sensibility represents not things in themselves, but their appearances: we shall easily comprehend, and at the same time indisputably prove, that all external objects of our world of sense must necessarily coincide in the most rigorous way with the propositions of geometry; because sensibility by means of its form of external intuition, viz., by space, the same with which the geometer is occupied, makes those objects at all possible as mere appearances.',
    'It will always remain a remarkable phenomenon in the history of philosophy, that there was a time, when even mathematicians, who at the same time were philosophers, began to doubt, not of the accuracy of their geometrical propositions so far as they concerned space, but of their objective validity and the applicability of this concept itself, and of all its corollaries, to nature. They showed much concern whether a line in nature might not consist of physical points, and consequently that true space in the object might consist of simple [discrete] parts, while the space which the geometer has in his mind [being continuous] cannot be such. They did not recognise that this mental space renders possible the physical space, i.e., the extension of matter; that this pure space is not at all a quality of things in themselves, but a form of our sensuous faculty of representation; and that all objects in space are mere appearances, i.e., not things in themselves but representations of our sensuous intuition. But such is the case, for the space of the geometer is exactly the form of sensuous intuition which we find a priori in us, and contains the ground of the possibility of all external appearances (according to their form), and the latter must necessarily and most rigidly agree with the propositions of the geometer, which he draws not from any fictitious concept, but from the subjective basis of all external phenomena, which is sensibility itself. In this and no other way can geometry be made secure as to the undoubted objective reality of its propositions against all the intrigues of a shallow Metaphysics, which is surprised at them [the geometrical propositions], because it has not traced them to the sources of their concepts.',
    'Remark II.',
    "Whatever is given us as object, must be given us in intuition. All our intuition however takes place by means of the senses only; the understanding intuites nothing, but only reflects. And as we have just shown that the senses never and in no manner enable us to know things in themselves, but only their appearances, which are mere representations of the sensibility, we conclude that 'all bodies, together with the space in which they are, must be considered nothing but mere representations in us, and exist nowhere but in our thoughts.' You will say: Is not this manifest idealism?",
    'Idealism consists in the assertion, that there are none but thinking beings, all other things, which we think are perceived in intuition, being nothing but representations in the thinking beings, to which no object external to them corresponds in fact. Whereas I say, that things as objects of our senses existing outside us are given, but we know nothing of what they may be in themselves, knowing only their appearances, i.e., the representations which they cause in us by affecting our senses. Consequently I grant by all means that there are bodies without us, that is, things which, though quite unknown to us as to what they are in themselves, we yet know by the representations which their influence on our sensibility procures us, and which we call bodies, a term signifying merely the appearance of the thing which is unknown to us, but not therefore less actual. Can this be termed idealism? It is the very contrary.',
    "Long before Locke's time, but assuredly since him, it has been generally assumed and granted without detriment to the actual existence of external things, that many of their predicates may be said to belong not to the things in themselves, but to their appearances, and to have no proper existence outside our representation. Heat, color, and taste, for instance, are of this kind. Now, if I go farther, and for weighty reasons rank as mere appearances the remaining qualities of bodies also, which are called primary, such as extension, place, and in general space, with all that which belongs to it (impenetrability or materiality, space, etc.)—no one in the least can adduce the reason of its being inadmissible. As little as the man who admits colors not to be properties of the object in itself, but only as modifications of the sense of sight, should on that account be called an idealist, so little can my system be named idealistic, merely because I find that more, nay,",
    'All the properties which constitute the intuition of a body belong merely to its appearance.',
    'The existence of the thing that appears is thereby not destroyed, as in genuine idealism, but it is only shown, that we cannot possibly know it by the senses as it is in itself.',
    'I should be glad to know what my assertions must be in order to avoid all idealism. Undoubtedly, I should say, that the representation of space is not only perfectly conformable to the relation which our sensibility has to objects—that I have said—but that it is quite similar to the object,—an assertion in which I can find as little meaning as if I said that the sensation of red has a similarity to the property of vermilion, which in me excites this sensation.',
    'Remark III.',
    'Hence we may at once dismiss an easily foreseen but futile objection, "that by admitting the ideality of space and of time the whole sensible world would be turned into mere sham." At first all philosophical insight into the nature of sensuous cognition was spoiled, by making the sensibility merely a confused mode of representation, according to which we still know things as they are, but without being able to reduce everything in this our representation to a clear consciousness; whereas proof is offered by us that sensibility consists, not in this logical distinction of clearness and obscurity, but in the genetical one of the origin of cognition itself. For sensuous perception represents things not at all as they are, but only the mode in which they affect our senses, and consequently by sensuous perception appearances only and not things themselves are given to the understanding for reflexion. After this necessary corrective, an objection rises from an unpardonable and almost intentional misconception, as if my doctrine turned all the things of the world of sense into mere illusion.',
    'When an appearance is given us, we are still quite free as to how we should judge the matter. The appearance depends upon the senses, but the judgment upon the understanding, and the only question is, whether in the determination of the object there is truth or not. But the difference between truth and dreaming is not ascertained by the nature of the representations, which are referred to objects (for they are the same in both cases), but by their connexion according to those rules, which determine the coherence of the representations in the concept of an object, and by ascertaining whether they can subsist together in experience or not. And it is not the fault of the appearances if our cognition takes illusion for truth, i.e., if the intuition, by which an object is given us, is considered a concept of the thing or of its existence also, which the understanding can only think. The senses represent to us the paths of the planets as now progressive, now retrogressive, and herein is neither falsehood nor truth, because as long as we hold this path to be nothing but appearance, we do not judge of the objective nature of their motion. But as a false judgment may easily arise when the understanding is not on its guard against this subjective mode of representation being considered objective, we say they appear to move backward; it is not the senses however which must be charged with the illusion, but the understanding, whose province alone it is to give an objective judgment on appearances.',
    'Thus, even if we did not at all reflect on the origin of our representations, whenever we connect our intuitions of sense (whatever they may contain), in space and in time, according to the rules of the coherence of all cognition in experience, illusion or truth will arise according as we are negligent or careful. It is merely a question of the use of sensuous representations in the understanding, and not of their origin. In the same way, if I consider all the representations of the senses, together with their form, space and time, to be nothing but appearances, and space and time to be a mere form of the sensibility, which is not to be met with in objects out of it, and if I make use of these representations in reference to possible experience only, there is nothing in my regarding them as appearances that can lead astray or cause illusion. For all that they can correctly cohere according to rules of truth in experience. Thus all the propositions of geometry hold good of space as well as of all the objects of the senses, consequently of all possible experience, whether I consider space as a mere form of the sensibility, or as something cleaving to the things themselves. In the former case however I comprehend how I can know a priori these propositions concerning all the objects of external intuition. Otherwise, everything else as regards all possible experience remains just as if I had not departed from the vulgar view.',
    'But if I venture to go beyond all possible experience with my notions of space and time, which I cannot refrain from doing if I proclaim them qualities inherent in things in themselves (for what should prevent me from letting them hold good of the same things, even though my senses might be different, and unsuited to them?), then a grave error may arise due to illusion, for thus I would proclaim to be universally valid what is merely a subjective condition of the intuition of things and sure only for all objects of sense, viz., for all possible experience; I would refer this condition to things in themselves, and do not limit it to the conditions of experience.',
    'My doctrine of the ideality of space and of time, therefore, far from reducing the whole sensible world to mere illusion, is the only means of securing the application of one of the most important cognitions (that which mathematics propounds a priori) to actual objects, and of preventing its being regarded as mere illusion. For without this observation it would be quite impossible to make out whether the intuitions of space and time, which we borrow from no experience, and which yet lie in our representation a priori, are not mere phantasms of our brain, to which objects do not correspond, at least not adequately, and consequently, whether we have been able to show its unquestionable validity with regard to all the objects of the sensible world just because they are mere appearances.',
    'Secondly, though these my principles make appearances of the representations of the senses, they are so far from turning the truth of experience into mere illusion, that they are rather the only means of preventing the transcendental illusion, by which metaphysics has hitherto been deceived, leading to the childish endeavor of catching at bubbles, because appearances, which are mere representations, were taken for things in themselves. Here originated the remarkable event of the antimony of Reason which I shall mention by and by, and which is destroyed by the single observation, that appearance, as long as it is employed in experience, produces truth, but the moment it transgresses the bounds of experience, and consequently becomes transcendent, produces nothing but illusion.',
    'Inasmuch, therefore, as I leave to things as we obtain them by the senses their actuality, and only limit our sensuous intuition of these things to this, that they represent in no respect, not even in the pure intuitions of space and of time, anything more than mere appearance of those things, but never their constitution in themselves, this is not a sweeping illusion invented for nature by me. My protestation too against all charges of idealism is so valid and clear as even to seem superfluous, were there not incompetent judges, who, while they would have an old name for every deviation from their perverse though common opinion, and never judge of the spirit of philosophic nomenclature, but cling to the letter only, are ready to put their own conceits in the place of well-defined notions, and thereby deform and distort them. I have myself given this my theory the name of transcendental idealism, but that cannot authorise any one to confound it either with the empirical idealism of Descartes, (indeed, his was only an insoluble problem, owing to which he thought every one at liberty to deny the existence of the corporeal world, because it could never be proved satisfactorily), or with the mystical and visionary idealism of Berkeley, against which and other similar phantasms our Critique contains the proper antidote. My idealism concerns not the existence of things (the doubting of which, however, constitutes idealism in the ordinary sense), since it never came into my head to doubt it, but it concerns the sensuous representation of things, to which space and time especially belong. Of these [viz., space and time], consequently of all appearances in general, I have only shown, that they are neither things (but mere modes of representation), nor determinations belonging to things in themselves. But the word "transcendental," which with me means a reference of our cognition, i.e., not to things, but only to the cognitive faculty, was meant to obviate this misconception. Yet rather than give further occasion to it by this word, I now retract it, and desire this idealism of mine to be called critical. But if it be really an objectionable idealism to convert actual things (not appearances) into mere representations, by what name shall we call him who conversely changes mere representations to things? It may, I think, be called "dreaming idealism," in contradistinction to the former, which may be called "visionary," both of which are to be refuted by my transcendental, or, better, critical idealism.',
    'SECOND PART OF THE TRANSCENDENTAL PROBLEM.',
    'HOW IS THE SCIENCE OF NATURE POSSIBLE?',
    '§ 14.',
    'NATURE is the existence of things, so far as it is determined according to universal laws. Should nature signify the existence of things in themselves, we could never cognise it either a priori or a posteriori. Not a priori, for how can we know what belongs to things in themselves, since this never can be done by the dissection of our concepts (in analytical judgments)? We do not want to know what is contained in our concept of a thing (for the [concept describes what] belongs to its logical being), but what is in the actuality of the thing superadded to our concept, and by what the thing itself is determined in its existence outside the concept. Our understanding, and the conditions on which alone it can connect the determinations of things in their existence, do not prescribe any rule to things themselves; these do not conform to our understanding, but it must conform itself to them; they must therefore be first given us in order to gather these determinations from them, wherefore they would not be cognised a priori.',
    'A cognition of the nature of things in themselves a posteriori would be equally impossible. For, if experience is to teach us laws, to which the existence of things is subject, these laws, if they regard things in themselves, must belong to them of necessity even outside our experience. But experience teaches us what exists and how it exists, but never that it must necessarily exist so and not otherwise. Experience therefore can never teach us the nature of things in themselves.',
    '§ 15.  We nevertheless actually possess a pure science of nature in which are propounded, a priori and with all the necessity requisite to apodeictical propositions, laws to which nature is subject. I need only call to witness that propaedeutic of natural science which, under the title of the universal Science of Nature, precedes all Physics (which is founded upon empirical principles). In it we have Mathematics applied to appearance, and also merely discursive principles (or those derived from concepts), which constitute the philosophical part of the pure cognition of nature. But there are several things in it, which are not quite pure and independent of empirical sources: such as the concept of motion, that of impenetrability (upon which the empirical concept of matter rests), that of inertia, and many others, which prevent its being called a perfectly pure science of nature. Besides, it only refers to objects of the external sense, and therefore does not give an example of a universal science of nature, in the strict sense, for such a science must reduce nature in general, whether it regards the object of the external or that of the internal sense (the object of Physics as well as Psychology), to universal laws. But among the principles of this universal physics there are a few which actually have the required universality; for instance, the propositions that "substance is permanent," and that "every event is determined by a cause according to constant laws," etc. These are actually universal laws of nature, which subsist completely a priori. There is then in fact a pure science of nature, and the question arises, How is it possible?',
    '§ 16.  The word "nature" assumes yet another meaning, which determines the object, whereas in the former sense it only denotes the conformity to law [Gesetzmässigkeit] of the determinations of the existence of things generally. If we consider it materialiter (i.e., in the matter that forms its objects) "nature is the complex of all the objects of experience." And with this only are we now concerned, for besides, things which can never be objects of experience, if they must be cognised as to their nature, would oblige us to have recourse to concepts whose meaning could never be given in concreto (by any example of possible experience). Consequently we must form for ourselves a list of concepts of their nature, the reality whereof (i.e., whether they actually refer to objects, or are mere creations of thought) could never be determined. The cognition of what cannot be an object of experience would be hyperphysical, and with things hyperphysical we are here not concerned, but only with the cognition of nature, the actuality of which can be confirmed by experience, though it [the cognition of nature] is possible a priori and precedes all experience.',
    '§ 17.  The formal [aspect] of nature in this narrower sense is therefore the conformity to law of all the objects of experience, and so far as it is cognised a priori, their necessary conformity. But it has just been shown that the laws of nature can never be cognised a priori in objects so far as they are considered not in reference to possible experience, but as things in themselves. And our inquiry here extends not to things in themselves (the properties of which we pass by), but to things as objects of possible experience, and the complex of these is what we properly designate as nature. And now I ask, when the possibility of a cognition of nature a priori is in question, whether it is better to arrange the problem thus: How can we cognise a priori that things as objects of experience necessarily conform to law? or thus: How is it possible to cognise a priori the necessary conformity to law of experience itself as regards all its objects generally?',
    'Closely considered, the solution of the problem, represented in either way, amounts, with regard to the pure cognition of nature (which is the point of the question at issue), entirely to the same thing. For the subjective laws, under which alone an empirical cognition of things is possible, hold good of these things, as Objects of possible experience (not as things in themselves, which are not considered here). Either of the following statements means quite the same:',
    'A judgment of observation can never rank as experience, without the law, that "whenever an event is observed, it is always referred to some antecedent, which it follows according to a universal rule."',
    '"Everything, of which experience teaches that it happens, must have a cause."',
    'It is, however, more commendable to choose the first formula. For we can a priori and previous to all given objects have a cognition of those conditions, on which alone experience is possible, but never of the laws to which things may in themselves be subject, without reference to possible experience. We cannot therefore study the nature of things a priori otherwise than by investigating the conditions and the universal (though subjective) laws, under which alone such a cognition as experience (as to mere form) is possible, and we determine accordingly the possibility of things, as objects of experience. For if I should choose the second formula, and seek the conditions a priori, on which nature as an object of experience is possible, I might easily fall into error, and fancy that I was speaking of nature as a thing in itself, and then move round in endless circles, in a vain search for laws concerning things of which nothing is given me.',
    'Accordingly we shall here be concerned with experience only, and the universal conditions of its possibility which are given a priori. Thence we shall determine nature as the whole object of all possible experience. I think it will be understood that I here do not mean the rules of the observation of a nature that is already given, for these already presuppose experience. I do not mean how (through experience) we can study the laws of nature; for these would not then be laws a priori, and would yield us no pure science of nature; but [I mean to ask] how the conditions a priori of the possibility of experience are at the same time the sources from which all the universal laws of nature must be derived.',
    '§ 18.  In the first place we must state that, while all judgments of experience (Erfahrungsurtheile) are empirical (i.e., have their ground in immediate sense perception), vice versa, all empirical judgments (empirische Urtheile) are not judgments of experience, but, besides the empirical, and in general besides what is given to the sensuous intuition, particular concepts must yet be superadded—concepts which have their origin quite a priori in the pure understanding, and under which every perception must be first of all subsumed and then by their means changed into experience.11',
    'Empirical judgments, so far as they have objective validity, are judgments of experience; but those which are only subjectively valid, I name mere judgments of perception. The latter require no pure concept of the understanding, but only the logical connexion of perception in a thinking subject. But the former always require, besides the representation of the sensuous intuition, particular concepts originally begotten in the understanding, which produce the objective validity of the judgment of experience.',
    'All our judgments are at first merely judgments of perception; they hold good only for us (i.e., for our subject), and we do not till afterwards give them a new reference (to an object), and desire that they shall always hold good for us and in the same way for everybody else; for when a judgment agrees with an object, all judgments concerning the same object must likewise agree among themselves, and thus the objective validity of the judgment of experience signifies nothing else than its necessary universality of application. And conversely when we have reason to consider a judgment necessarily universal (which never depends upon perception, but upon the pure concept of the understanding, under which the perception is subsumed), we must consider it objective also, that is, that it expresses not merely a reference of our perception to a subject, but a quality of the object. For there would be no reason for the judgments of other men necessarily agreeing with mine, if it were not the unity of the object to which they all refer, and with which they accord; hence they must all agree with one another.',
    '§ 19.  Therefore objective validity and necessary universality (for everybody) are equivalent terms, and though we do not know the object in itself, yet when we consider a judgment as universal, and also necessary, we understand it to have objective validity. By this judgment we cognise the object (though it remains unknown as it is in itself) by the universal and necessary connexion of the given perceptions. As this is the case with all objects of sense, judgments of experience take their objective validity not from the immediate cognition of the object (which is impossible), but from the condition of universal validity in empirical judgments, which, as already said, never rests upon empirical, or, in short, sensuous conditions, but upon a pure concept of the understanding. The object always remains unknown in itself; but when by the concept of the understanding the connexion of the representations of the object, which are given to our sensibility, is determined as universally valid, the object is determined by this relation, and it is the judgment that is objective.',
    'To illustrate the matter: When we say, "the room is warm, sugar sweet, and wormwood bitter"12—we have only subjectively valid judgments. I do not at all expect that I or any other person shall always find it as I now do; each of these sentences only expresses a relation of two sensations to the same subject, to myself, and that only in my present state of perception; consequently they are not valid of the object. Such are judgments of perception. Judgments of experience are of quite a different nature. What experience teaches me under certain circumstances, it must always teach me and everybody; and its validity is not limited to the subject nor to its state at a particular time. Hence I pronounce all such judgments as being objectively valid. For instance, when I say the air is elastic, this judgment is as yet a judgment of perception only—I do nothing but refer two of my sensations to one another. But, if I would have it called a judgment of experience, I require this connexion to stand under a condition, which makes it universally valid. I desire therefore that I and everybody else should always connect necessarily the same perceptions under the same circumstances.',
    '§ 20.  We must consequently analyse experience in order to see what is contained in this product of the senses and of the understanding, and how the judgment of experience itself is possible.  The foundation is the intuition of which I become conscious, i.e., perception (perceptio), which pertains merely to the senses. But in the next place, there are acts of judging (which belong only to the understanding). But this judging may be twofold—first, I may merely compare perceptions and connect them in a particular state of my consciousness; or, secondly, I may connect them in consciousness generally. The former judgment is merely a judgment of perception, and of subjective validity only: it is merely a connexion of perceptions in my mental state, without reference to the object. Hence it is not, as is commonly imagined, enough for experience to compare perceptions and to connect them in consciousness through judgment; there arises no universality and necessity, for which alone judgments can become objectively valid and be called experience.',
    'Quite another judgment therefore is required before perception can become experience. The given intuition must be subsumed under a concept, which determines the form of judging in general relatively to the intuition, connects its empirical consciousness in consciousness generally, and thereby procures universal validity for empirical judgments. A concept of this nature is a pure a priori concept of the Understanding, which does nothing but determine for an intuition the general way in which it can be used for judgments. Let the concept be that of cause, then it determines the intuition which is subsumed under it, e.g., that of air, relative to judgments in general, viz., the concept of air serves with regard to its expansion in the relation of antecedent to consequent in a hypothetical judgment. The concept of cause accordingly is a pure concept of the understanding, which is totally disparate from all possible perception, and only serves to determine the representation subsumed under it, relatively to judgments in general, and so to make a universally valid judgment possible.',
    'Before, therefore, a judgment of perception can become a judgment of experience, it is requisite that the perception should be subsumed under some such a concept of the understanding; for instance, air ranks under the concept of causes, which determines our judgment about it in regard to its expansion as hypothetical.13 Thereby the expansion of the air is represented not as merely belonging to the perception of the air in my present state or in several states of mine, or in the state of perception of others, but as belonging to it necessarily. The judgment, "the air is elastic," becomes universally valid, and a judgment of experience, only by certain judgments preceding it, which subsume the intuition of air under the concept of cause and effect: and they thereby determine the perceptions not merely as regards one another in me, but relatively to the form of judging in general, which is here hypothetical, and in this way they render the empirical judgment universally valid.',
    'If all our synthetical judgments are analysed so far as they are objectively valid, it will be found that they never consist of mere intuitions connected only (as is commonly believed) by comparison into a judgment; but that they would be impossible were not a pure concept of the understanding superadded to the concepts abstracted from intuition, under which concept these latter are subsumed, and in this manner only combined into an objectively valid judgment. Even the judgments of pure mathematics in their simplest axioms are not exempt from this condition. The principle, "a straight line is the shortest between two points," presupposes that the line is subsumed under the concept of quantity, which certainly is no mere intuition, but has its seat in the understanding alone, and serves to determine the intuition (of the line) with regard to the judgments which may be made about it, relatively to their quantity, that is, to plurality (as judicia plurativa).14 For under them it is understood that in a given intuition there is contained a plurality of homogenous parts.',
    '§ 21.  To prove, then, the possibility of experience so far as it rests upon pure concepts of the understanding a priori, we must first represent what belongs to judgments in general and the various functions of the understanding, in a complete table. For the pure concepts of the understanding must run parallel to these functions, as such concepts are nothing more than concepts of intuitions in general, so far as these are determined by one or other of these functions of judging, in themselves, that is, necessarily and universally. Hereby also the a priori principles of the possibility of all experience, as of an objectively valid empirical cognition, will be precisely determined. For they are nothing but propositions by which all perception is (under certain universal conditions of intuition) subsumed under those pure concepts of the understanding.',

    '§ 21a.  In order to comprise the whole matter in one idea, it is first necessary to remind the reader that we are discussing not the origin of experience, but of that which lies in experience. The former pertains to empirical psychology, and would even then never be adequately explained without the latter, which belongs to the Critique of cognition, and particularly of the understanding.',
    'Experience consists of intuitions, which belong to the sensibility, and of judgments, which are entirely a work of the understanding. But the judgments, which the understanding forms alone from sensuous intuitions, are far from being judgments of experience. For in the one case the judgment connects only the perceptions as they are given in the sensuous intuition, while in the other the judgments must express what experience in general, and not what the mere perception (which possesses only subjective validity) contains. The judgment of experience must therefore add to the sensuous intuition and its logical connexion in a judgment (after it has been rendered universal by comparison) something that determines the synthetical judgment as necessary and therefore as universally valid. This can be nothing else than that concept which represents the intuition as determined in itself with regard to one form of judgment rather than another, viz., a concept of that synthetical unity of intuitions which can only be represented by a given logical function of judgments.',
    '§ 22.  The sum of the matter is this: the business of the senses is to intuite—that of the understanding is to think. But thinking is uniting representations in one consciousness. This union originates either merely relative to the subject, and is accidental and subjective, or is absolute, and is necessary or objective. The union of representations in one consciousness is judgment. Thinking therefore is the same as judging, or referring representations to judgments in general. Hence judgments are either merely subjective, when representations are referred to a consciousness in one subject only, and united in it, or objective, when they are united in a consciousness generally, that is, necessarily.  The logical functions of all judgments are but various modes of uniting representations in consciousness. But if they serve for concepts, they are concepts of their necessary union in a consciousness, and so principles of objectively valid judgments. This union in a consciousness is either analytical, by identity, or synthetical, by the combination and addition of various representations one to another. Experience consists in the synthetical connexion of phenomena (perceptions) in consciousness, so far as this connexion is necessary. Hence the pure concepts of the understanding are those under which all perceptions must be subsumed ere they can serve for judgments of experience, in which the synthetical unity of the perceptions is represented as necessary and universally valid.15',
    '§ 23.  Judgments, when considered merely as the condition of the union of given representations in a consciousness, are rules. These rules, so far as they represent the union as necessary, are rules a priori, and so far as they cannot be deduced from higher rules, are fundamental principles. But in regard to the possibility of all experience, merely in relation to the form of thinking in it, no conditions of judgments of experience are higher than those which bring the phenomena, according to the various form of their intuition, under pure concepts of the understanding, and render the empirical judgment objectively valid. These concepts are therefore the a priori principles of possible experience.',
    'The principles of possible experience are then at the same time universal laws of nature, which can be cognised a priori. And thus the problem in our second question, "How is the pure Science of Nature possible?" is solved. For the system which is required for the form of a science is to be met with in perfection here, because, beyond the above-mentioned formal conditions of all judgments in general offered in logic, no others are possible, and these constitute a logical system. The concepts grounded thereupon, which contain the a priori conditions of all synthetical and necessary judgments, accordingly constitute a transcendental system. Finally the principles, by means of which all phenomena are subsumed under these concepts, constitute a physical16 system, that is, a system of nature, which precedes all empirical cognition of nature, makes it even possible, and hence may in strictness be denominated the universal and pure science of nature.',
    '§ 24.  The first one17 of the physiological principles subsumes all phenomena, as intuitions in space and time, under the concept of Quantity, and is so far a principle of the application of Mathematics to experience. The second one subsumes the empirical element, viz., sensation which denotes the real in intuitions, not indeed directly under the concept of quantity, because sensation is not an intuition that contains either space or time, though it places the respective object into both. But still there is between reality (sense-representation) and the zero, or total void of intuition in time, a difference which has a quantity. For between every given degree of light and of darkness, between every degree of heat and of absolute cold, between every degree of weight and of absolute lightness, between every degree of occupied space and of totally void space, diminishing degrees can be conceived, in the same manner as between consciousness and total unconsciousness (the darkness of a psychological blank) ever diminishing degrees obtain. Hence there is no perception that can prove an absolute absence of it; for instance, no psychological darkness that cannot be considered as a kind of consciousness. This occurs in all cases of sensation, and so the understanding can anticipate even sensations, which constitute the peculiar quality of empirical representations (appearances), by means of the principle: "that they all have (consequently that what is real in all phenomena has) a degree." Here is the second application of mathematics (mathesis intensorum) to the science of nature.',
    '§ 25.  Anent the relation of appearances merely with a view to their existence, the determination is not mathematical but dynamical, and can never be objectively valid, consequently never fit for experience, if it does not come under a priori principles by which the cognition of experience relative to appearances becomes even possible. Hence appearances must be subsumed under the concept of Substance, which is the foundation of all determination of existence, as a concept of the thing itself; or secondly—so far as, a succession is found among phenomena, that is, an event—under the concept of an Effect with reference to Cause; or lastly—so far as coexistence is to be known objectively, that is, by a judgment of experience—under the concept of Community (action and reaction).18 Thus a priori principles form the basis of objectively valid, though empirical judgments, that is, of the possibility of experience so far as it must connect objects as existing in nature. These principles are the proper laws of nature, which may be termed dynamical.',
    'Finally the cognition of the agreement and connexion not only of appearances among themselves in experience, but of their relation to experience in general, belongs to the judgments of experience. This relation contains either their agreement with the formal conditions, which the understanding cognises, or their coherence with the materials of the senses and of perception, or combines both into one concept. Consequently it contains Possibility, Actuality, and Necessity according to universal laws of nature; and this constitutes the physical doctrine of method, or the distinction of truth and of hypotheses, and the bounds of the certainty of the latter.',
    '§ 26.  The third table of Principles drawn from the nature of the understanding itself after the critical method, shows an inherent perfection, which raises it far above every other table which has hitherto though in vain been tried or may yet be tried by analysing the objects themselves dogmatically. It exhibits all synthetical a priori principles completely and according to one principle, viz., the faculty of judging in general, constituting the essence of experience as regards the understanding, so that we can be certain that there are no more such principles, a satisfaction such as can never be attained by the dogmatical method. Yet is this not all: there is a still greater merit in it.',
    'We must carefully bear in mind the proof which shows the possibility of this cognition a priori, and at the same time limits all such principles to a condition which must never be lost sight of, if we desire it not to be misunderstood, and extended in use beyond the original sense which the understanding attaches to it. This limit is that they contain nothing but the conditions of possible experience in general so far as it is subjected to laws a priori. Consequently I do not say, that things in themselves possess a quantity, that their actuality possesses a degree, their existence a connexion of accidents in a substance, etc. This nobody can prove, because such a synthetical connexion from mere concepts, without any reference to sensuous intuition on the one side, or connexion of it in a possible experience on the other, is absolutely impossible. The essential limitation of the concepts in these principles then is: That all things stand necessarily a priori under the afore-mentioned conditions, as objects of experience only.',
    'Hence there follows secondly a specifically peculiar mode of proof of these principles: they are not directly referred to appearances and to their relations, but to the possibility of experience, of which appearances constitute the matter only, not the form. Thus they are referred to objectively and universally valid synthetical propositions, in which we distinguish judgments of experience from those of perception. This takes place because appearances, as mere intuitions, occupying a part of space and time, come under the concept of Quantity, which unites their multiplicity a priori according to rules synthetically. Again, so far as the perception contains, besides intuition, sensibility, and between the latter and nothing (i.e., the total disappearance of sensibility), there is an ever decreasing transition, it is apparent that that which is in appearances must have a degree, so far as it (viz., the perception) does not itself occupy any part of space or of time.19 Still the transition to actuality from empty time or empty space is only possible in time; consequently though sensibility, as the quality of empirical intuition, can never be cognised a priori, by its specific difference from other sensibilities, yet it can, in a possible experience in general, as a quantity of perception be intensely distinguished from every other similar perception. Hence the application of mathematics to nature, as regards the sensuous intuition by which nature is given to us, becomes possible and is thus determined.',
    'Above all, the reader must pay attention to the mode of proof of the principles which occur under the title of Analogies of experience. For these do not refer to the genesis of intuitions, as do the principles of applied mathematics, but to the connexion of their existence in experience; and this can be nothing but the determination of their existence in time according to necessary laws, under which alone the connexion is objectively valid, and thus becomes experience. The proof therefore does not turn on the synthetical unity in the connexion of things in themselves, but merely of perceptions, and of these not in regard to their matter, but to the determination of time and of the relation of their existence in it, according to universal laws. If the empirical determination in relative time is indeed objectively valid (i.e., experience), these universal laws contain the necessary determination of existence in time generally (viz., according to a rule of the understanding a priori).',
    'In these Prolegomena I cannot further descant on the subject, but my reader (who has probably been long accustomed to consider experience a mere empirical synthesis of perceptions, and hence not considered that it goes much beyond them, as it imparts to empirical judgments universal validity, and for that purpose requires a pure and a priori unity of the understanding) is recommended to pay special attention to this distinction of experience from a mere aggregate of perceptions, and to judge the mode of proof from this point of view.',
    "§ 27.  Now we are prepared to remove Hume's doubt. He justly maintains, that we cannot comprehend by reason the possibility of Causality, that is, of the reference of the existence of one thing to the existence of another, which is necessitated by the former. I add, that we comprehend just as little the concept of Subsistence, that is, the necessity that at the foundation of the existence of things there lies a subject which cannot itself be a predicate of any other thing; nay, we cannot even form a notion of the possibility of such a thing (though we can point out examples of its use in experience). The very same in comprehensibility affects the Community of things, as we cannot comprehend how from the state of one thing an inference to the state of quite another thing beyond it, and vice versa, can be drawn, and how substances which have each their own separate existence should depend upon one another necessarily. But I am very far from holding these concepts to be derived merely from experience, and the necessity represented in them, to be imaginary and a mere illusion produced in us by long habit. On the contrary, I have amply shown, that they and the theorems derived from them are firmly established a priori, or before all experience, and have their undoubted objective value, though only with regard to experience.",
    '§ 28. Though I have no notion of such a connexion of things in themselves, that they can either exist as substances, or act as causes, or stand in community with others (as parts of a real whole), and I can just as little conceive such properties in appearances as such (because those concepts contain nothing that lies in the appearances, but only what the understanding alone must think): we have yet a notion of such a connexion of representations in our understanding, and in judgments generally; consisting in this that representations appear in one sort of judgments as subject in relation to predicates, in another as reason in relation to consequences, and in a third as parts, which constitute together a total possible cognition. Besides we cognise a priori that without considering the representation of an object as determined in some of these respects, we can have no valid cognition of the object, and, if we should occupy ourselves about the object in itself, there is no possible attribute, by which I could know that it is determined under any of these aspects, that is, under the concept either of substance, or of cause, or (in relation to other substances) of community, for I have no notion of the possibility of such a connexion of existence. But the question is not how things in themselves, but how the empirical cognition of things is determined, as regards the above aspects of judgments in general, that is, how things, as objects of experience, can and shall be subsumed under these concepts of the understanding. And then it is clear, that I completely comprehend not only the possibility, but also the necessity of subsuming all phenomena under these concepts, that is, of using them for principles of the possibility of experience.',
    '§ 29.  When making an experiment with Hume\'s problematical concept (his crux metaphysicorum), the concept of cause, we have, in the first place, given a priori, by means of logic, the form of a conditional judgment in general, i.e., we have one given cognition as antecedent and another as consequence. But it is possible, that in perception we may meet with a rule of relation, which runs thus: that a certain phenomenon is constantly followed by another (though not conversely), and this is a case for me to use the hypothetical judgment, and, for instance, to say, it the sun shines long enough upon a body, it grows warm. Here there is indeed as yet no necessity of connexion, or concept of cause. But I proceed and say, that if this proposition, which is merely a subjective connexion of perceptions, is to be a judgment of experience, it must be considered as necessary and universally valid. Such a proposition would be, "the sun is by its light the cause of heat." The empirical rule is now considered as a law, and as valid not merely of appearances but valid of them for the purposes of a possible experience which requires universal and therefore necessarily valid rules. I therefore easily comprehend the concept of cause, as a concept necessarily belonging to the mere form of experience, and its possibility as a synthetical union of perceptions in consciousness generally; but I do not at all comprehend the possibility of a thing generally as a cause, because the concept of cause denotes a condition not at all belonging to things, but to experience. It is nothing in fact but an objectively valid cognition of appearances and of their succession, so far as the antecedent can be conjoined with the consequent according to the rule of hypothetical judgments.',
    '§ 30.  Hence if the pure concepts of the understanding do not refer to objects of experience but to things in themselves (noumena), they have no signification whatever. They serve, as it were, only to decipher appearances, that we may be able to read them as experience. The principles which arise from their reference to the sensible world, only serve our understanding for empirical use. Beyond this they are arbitrary combinations, without objective reality, and we can neither cognise their possibility a priori, nor verify their reference to objects, let alone make it intelligible by any example; because examples can only be borrowed from some possible experience, consequently the objects of these concepts can be found nowhere but in a possible experience.',
    "This complete (though to its originator unexpected) solution of Hume's problem rescues for the pure concepts of the understanding their a priori origin, and for the universal laws of nature their validity, as laws of the understanding, yet in such a way as to limit their use to experience, because their possibility depends solely on the reference of the understanding to experience, but with a completely reversed mode of connexion which never occurred to Hume, not by deriving them from experience, but by deriving experience from them.",
    'This is therefore the result of all our foregoing inquiries: "All synthetical principles a priori are nothing more than principles of possible experience, and can never be referred to things in themselves, but to appearances as objects of experience. And hence pure mathematics as well as a pure science of nature can never be referred to anything more than mere appearances, and can only represent either that which makes experience generally possible, or else that which, as it is derived from these principles, must always be capable of being represented in some possible experience.',
    '§ 31.  And thus we have at last something definite, upon which to depend in all metaphysical enterprises, which have hitherto, boldly enough but always at random, attempted everything without discrimination. That the aim of their exertions should be so near, struck neither the dogmatical thinkers nor those who, confident in their supposed sound common sense, started with concepts and principles of pure reason (which were legitimate and natural, but destined for mere empirical use) in quest of fields of knowledge, to which they neither knew nor could know any determinate bounds, because they had never reflected nor were able to reflect on the nature or even on the possibility of such a pure understanding.',
    'Many a naturalist of pure reason (by which I mean the man who believes he can decide in matters of metaphysics without any science) may pretend, that he long ago by the prophetic spirit of his sound sense, not only suspected, but knew and comprehended, what is here propounded with so much ado, or, if he likes, with prolix and pedantic pomp: "that with all our reason we can never reach beyond the field of experience." But when he is questioned about his rational principles individually, he must grant, that there are many of them which he has not taken from experience, and which are therefore independent of it and valid a priori. How then and on what grounds will he restrain both himself and the dogmatist, who makes use of these concepts and principles beyond all possible experience, because they are recognised to be independent of it? And even he, this adept in sound sense, in spite of all his assumed and cheaply acquired wisdom, is not exempt from wandering inadvertently beyond objects of experience into the field of chimeras. He is often deeply enough involved in them, though in announcing everything as mere probability, rational conjecture, or analogy, he gives by his popular language a color to his groundless pretensions.',
    '§ 32.  Since the oldest days of philosophy inquirers into pure reason have conceived, besides the things of sense, or appearances (phenomena), which make up the sensible world, certain creations of the understanding (Verstandeswesen), called noumena, which should constitute an intelligible world. And as appearance and illusion were by those men identified (a thing which we may well excuse in an undeveloped epoch), actuality was only conceded to the creations of thought.',
    'And we indeed, rightly considering objects of sense as mere appearances, confess thereby that they are based upon a thing in itself, though we know not this thing in its internal constitution, but only know its appearances, viz., the way in which our senses are affected by this unknown something. The understanding therefore, by assuming appearances, grants the existence of things in themselves also, and so far we may say, that the representation of such things as form the basis of phenomena, consequently of mere creations of the understanding, is not only admissible, but unavoidable.',
    'Our critical deduction by no means excludes things of that sort (noumena), but rather limits the principles of the Aesthetic (the science of the sensibility) to this, that they shall not extend to all things, as everything would then be turned into mere appearance, but that they shall only hold good of objects of possible experience. Hereby then objects of the understanding are granted, but with the inculcation of this rule which admits of no exception: "that we neither know nor can know anything at all definite of these pure objects of the understanding, because our pure concepts of the understanding as well as our pure intuitions extend to nothing but objects of possible experience, consequently to mere things of sense, and as soon as we leave this sphere these concepts retain no meaning whatever."',
    '§ 33.  There is indeed something seductive in our pure concepts of the understanding, which tempts us to a transcendent use, —a use which transcends all possible experience. Not only are our concepts of substance, of power, of action, of reality, and others, quite independent of experience, containing nothing of sense appearance, and so apparently applicable to things in themselves (noumena), but, what strengthens this conjecture, they contain a necessity of determination in themselves, which experience never attains. The concept of cause implies a rule, according to which one state follows another necessarily; but experience can only show us, that one state of things often, or at most, commonly, follows another, and therefore affords neither strict universality, nor necessity.',
    'Hence the Categories seem to have a deeper meaning and import than can be exhausted by their empirical use, and so the understanding inadvertently adds for itself to the house of experience a much more extensive wing, which it fills with nothing but creatures of thought, without ever observing that it has transgressed with its otherwise lawful concepts the bounds of their use.',
    '§ 34.  Two important, and even indispensable, though very dry, investigations had therefore become indispensable in the Critique of Pure Reason,—viz., the two chapters "Vom Schematismus der reinen Verstandsbegriffe," and "Vom Grunde der Unterscheidung aller Verstandesbegriffe überhaupt in Phänomena und Noumena." In the former it is shown, that the senses furnish not the pure concepts of the understanding in concreto, but only the schedule for their use, and that the object conformable to it occurs only in experience (as the product of the understanding from materials of the sensibility). In the latter it is shown, that, although our pure concepts of the understanding and our principles are independent of experience, and despite of the apparently greater sphere of their use, still nothing whatever can be thought by them beyond the field of experience, because they can do nothing but merely determine the logical form of the judgment relatively to given intuitions. But as there is no intuition at all beyond the field of the sensibility, these pure concepts, as they cannot possibly be exhibited in concreto, are void of all meaning; consequently all these noumena, together with their complex, the intelligible world,20 are nothing but representation of a problem, of which the object in itself is possible, but the solution, from the nature of our understanding, totally impossible. For our understanding is not a faculty of intuition, but of the connexion of given intuitions in experience. Experience must therefore contain all the objects for our concepts; but beyond it no concepts have any significance, as there is no intuition that might offer them a foundation.',
    '§ 35.  The imagination may perhaps be forgiven for occasional vagaries, and for not keeping carefully within the limits of experience, since it gains life and vigor by such flights, and since it is always easier to moderate its boldness, than to stimulate its languor. But the understanding which ought to think can never be forgiven for indulging in vagaries; for we depend upon it alone for assistance to set bounds, when necessary, to the vagaries of the imagination.',
    'But the understanding begins its aberrations very innocently and modestly. It first elucidates the elementary cognitions, which inhere in it prior to all experience, but yet must always have their application in experience. It gradually drops these limits, and what is there to prevent it, as it has quite freely derived its principles from itself? And then it proceeds first to newly-imagined powers in nature, then to beings, outside nature; in short to a world, for whose construction the materials cannot be wanting, because fertile fiction furnishes them abundantly, and though not confirmed, is never refuted, by experience. This is the reason that young thinkers are so partial to metaphysics of the truly dogmatical kind, and often sacrifice to it their time and their talents, which might be otherwise better employed.',
    "But there is no use in trying to moderate these fruitless endeavors of pure reason by all manner of cautions as to the difficulties of solving questions so occult, by complaints of the limits of our reason, and by degrading our assertions into mere conjectures. For if their impossibility is not distinctly shown, and reason's cognition of its own essence does not become a true science, in which the field of its right use is distinguished, so to say, with mathematical certainty from that of its worthless and idle use, these fruitless efforts will never be abandoned for good.",
    '§ 36.  How is Nature itself possible?',
    'This question—the highest point that transcendental philosophy can ever reach, and to which, as its boundary and completion, it must proceed—properly contains two questions.',
    'First: How is nature at all possible in the material sense, by intuition, considered as the totality of appearances; how are space, time, and that which fills both—the object of sensation, in general possible? The answer is: By means of the constitution of our Sensibility, according to which it is specifically affected by objects, which are in themselves unknown to it, and totally distinct from those phenomena. This answer is given in the Critique itself in the transcendental Aesthetic, and in these Prolegomena by the solution of the first general problem.',
    'Secondly: How is nature possible in the formal sense, as the totality of the rules, under which all phenomena must come, in order to be thought as connected in experience? The answer must be this: It is only possible by means of the constitution of our Understanding, according to which all the above representations of the sensibility are necessarily referred to a consciousness, and by which the peculiar way in which we think (viz., by rules), and hence experience also, are possible, but must be clearly distinguished from an insight into the objects in themselves. This answer is given in the Critique itself in the transcendental Logic, and in these Prolegomena, in the course of the solution of the second main problem.',
    'But how this peculiar property of our sensibility itself is possible, or that of our understanding and of the apperception which is necessarily its basis and that of all thinking, cannot be further analysed or answered, because it is of them that we are in need for all our answers and for all our thinking about objects.',
    'There are many laws of nature, which we can only know by means of experience; but conformity to law in the connexion of appearances, i.e., in nature in general, we cannot discover by any experience, because experience itself requires laws which are a priori at the basis of its possibility.',
    'The possibility of experience in general is therefore at the same time the universal law of nature, and the principles of the experience are the very laws of nature. For we do not know nature but as the totality of appearances, i.e., of representations in us, and hence we can only derive the laws of its connexion from the principles of their connexion in us, that is, from the conditions of their necessary union in consciousness, which constitutes the possibility of experience.',
    'Even the main proposition expounded throughout this section—that universal laws of nature can be distinctly cognised a priori—leads naturally to the proposition: that the highest legislation of nature must lie in ourselves, i.e., in our understanding, and that we must not seek the universal laws of nature in nature by means of experience, but conversely must seek nature, as to its universal conformity to law, in the conditions of the possibility of experience, which lie in our sensibility and in our understanding. For how were it otherwise possible to know a priori these laws, as they are not rules of analytical cognition, but truly synthetical extensions of it?',
    'Such a necessary agreement of the principles of possible experience with the laws of the possibility of nature, can only proceed from one of two reasons: either these laws are drawn from nature by means of experience, or conversely nature is derived from the laws of the possibility of experience in general, and is quite the same as the mere universal conformity to law of the latter. The former is self-contradictory, for the universal laws of nature can and must be cognised a priori (that is, independent of all experience), and be the foundation of all empirical use of the understanding; the latter alternative therefore alone remains.21',
    'But we must distinguish the empirical laws of nature, which always presuppose particular perceptions, from the pure or universal laws of nature, which, without being based on particular perceptions, contain merely the conditions of their necessary union in experience. In relation to the latter, nature and possible experience are quite the same, and as the conformity to law here depends upon the necessary connexion of appearances in experience (without which we cannot cognise any object whatever in the sensible world), consequently upon the original laws of the understanding, it seems at first strange, but is not the less certain, to say:',
    'The understanding does not derive its laws (a priori) from, but prescribes them to, nature.',
    '§ 37.  We shall illustrate this seemingly bold proposition by an example, which will show, that laws, which we discover in objects of sensuous intuition (especially when these laws are cognised as necessary), are commonly held by us to be such as have been placed there by the understanding, in spite of their being similar in all points to the laws of nature, which we ascribe to experience.',
    '§ 38.  If we consider the properties of the circle, by which this figure combines so many arbitrary determinations of space in itself, at once in a universal rule, we cannot avoid attributing a constitution (eine Natur) to this geometrical thing. Two right lines, for example, which intersect one another and the circle, howsoever they may be drawn, are always divided so that the rectangle constructed with the segments of the one is equal to that constructed with the segments of the other. The question now is: Does this law lie in the circle or in the understanding, that is, Does this figure, independently of the understanding, contain in itself the ground of the law, or does the understanding, having constructed according to its concepts (according to the quality of the radii) the figure itself, introduce into it this law of the chords cutting one another in geometrical proportion? When we follow the proofs of this law, we soon perceive, that it can only be derived from the condition on which the understanding founds the construction of this figure, and which is that of the equality of the radii. But, if we enlarge this concept, to pursue further the unity of various properties of geometrical figures under common laws, and consider the circle as a conic section, which of course is subject to the same fundamental conditions of construction as other conic sections, we shall find that all the chords which intersect within the ellipse, parabola, and hyperbola, always intersect so that the rectangles of their segments are not indeed equal, but always bear a constant ratio to one another. If we proceed still farther, to the fundamental laws of physical astronomy, we find a physical law of reciprocal attraction diffused over all material nature, the rule of which is: "that it decreases inversely as the square of the distance from each attracting point, i.e., as the spherical surfaces increase, over which this force spreads," which law seems to be necessarily inherent in the very nature of things, and hence is usually propounded as cognisable a priori. Simple as the sources of this law are, merely resting upon the relation of spherical surfaces of different radii, its consequences are so valuable with regard to the variety of their agreement and its regularity, that not only are all possible orbits of the celestial bodies conic sections, but such a relation of these orbits to each other results, that no other law of attraction, than that of the inverse square of the distance, can be imagined as fit for a cosmical system.',
    'Here accordingly is a nature that rests upon laws which the understanding cognises a priori, and chiefly from the universal principles of the determination of space. Now I ask:',
    'Do the laws of nature lie in space, and does the understanding learn them by merely endeavoring to find out the enormous wealth of meaning that lies in space; or do they inhere in the understanding and in the way in which it determines space according to the conditions of the synthetical unity in which its concepts are all centred?',
    'Space is something so uniform and as to all particular properties so indeterminate, that we should certainly not seek a store of laws of nature in it. Whereas that which determines space to assume the form of a circle or the figures of a cone and a sphere, is the understanding, so far as it contains the ground of the unity of their constructions.',
    'The mere universal form of intuition, called space, must therefore be the substratum of all intuitions determinable to particular objects, and in it of course the condition of the possibility and of the variety of these intuitions lies. But the unity of the objects is entirely determined by the understanding, and on conditions which lie in its own nature; and thus the understanding is the origin of the universal order of nature, in that it comprehends all appearances under its own laws, and thereby first constructs, a priori, experience (as to its form), by means of which whatever is to be cognised only by experience, is necessarily subjected to its laws. For we are not now concerned with the nature of things in themselves, which is independent of the conditions both of our sensibility and our understanding, but with nature, as an object of possible experience, and in this case the understanding, whilst it makes experience possible, thereby insists that the sensuous world is either not an object of experience at all, or must be nature [viz., an existence of things, determined according to universal laws22].',
    'APPENDIX TO THE PURE SCIENCE OF NATURE.',
    '§ 39.  Of the System of the Categories.',
    'There can be nothing more desirable to a philosopher, than to be able to derive the scattered multiplicity of the concepts or the principles, which had occurred to him in concrete use, from a principle a priori, and to unite everything in this way in one cognition. He formerly only believed that those things, which remained after a certain abstraction, and seemed by comparison among one another to constitute a particular kind of cognitions, were completely collected; but this was only an Aggregate. Now he knows, that just so many, neither more nor less, can constitute the mode of cognition, and perceives the necessity of his division, which constitutes comprehension; and now only he has attained a System.',
    'To search in our daily cognition for the concepts, which do not rest upon particular experience, and yet occur in all cognition of experience, where they as it were constitute the mere form of connexion, presupposes neither greater reflexion nor deeper insight, than to detect in a language the rules of the actual use of words generally, and thus to collect elements for a grammar. In fact both researches are very nearly related, even though we are not able to give a reason why each language has just this and no other formal constitution, and still less why an exact number of such formal determinations in general are found in it.',
    'Aristotle collected ten pure elementary concepts under the name of Categories.23 To these, which are also called predicaments, he found himself obliged afterwards to add five post-predicaments,24 some of which however (prius, simul, and motus) are contained in the former; but this random collection must be considered (and commended) as a mere hint for future inquirers, not as a regularly developed idea, and hence it has, in the present more advanced state of philosophy, been rejected as quite useless.',
    'After long reflexion on the pure elements of human knowledge (those which contain nothing empirical), I at last succeeded in distinguishing with certainty and in separating the pure elementary notions of the Sensibility (space and time) from those of the Understanding. Thus the 7th, 8th, and 9th Categories had to be excluded from the old list. And the others were of no service to me; because there was no principle [in them], on which the understanding could be investigated, measured in its completion, and all the functions, whence its pure concepts arise, determined exhaustively and with precision.',
    'But in order to discover such a principle, I looked about for an act of the understanding which comprises all the rest, and is distinguished only by various modifications or phases, in reducing the multiplicity of representation to the unity of thinking in general: I found this act of the understanding to consist in judging. Here then the labors of the logicians were ready at hand, though not yet quite free from defects, and with this help I was enabled to exhibit a complete table of the pure functions of the understanding, which are however undetermined in regard to any object. I finally referred these functions of judging to objects in general, or rather to the condition of determining judgments as objectively valid, and so there arose the pure concepts of the understanding, concerning which I could make certain, that these, and this exact number only, constitute our whole cognition of things from pure understanding. I was justified in calling them by their old name, Categories, while I reserved for myself the liberty of adding, under the title of "Predicables," a complete list of all the concepts deducible from them, by combinations whether among themselves, or with the pure form of the appearance, i.e., space or time, or with its matter, so far as it is not yet empirically determined (viz., the object of sensation in general), as soon as a system of transcendental philosophy should be completed with the construction of which I am engaged in the Critique of Pure Reason itself.',
    'Now the essential point in this system of Categories, which distinguishes it from the old rhapsodical collection without any principle, and for which alone it deserves to be considered as philosophy, consists in this: that by means of it the true significance of the pure concepts of the understanding and the condition of their use could be precisely determined. For here it became obvious that they are themselves nothing but logical functions, and as such do not produce the least concept of an object, but require some sensuous intuition as a basis. They therefore only serve to determine empirical judgments, which are otherwise undetermined and indifferent as regards all functions of judging, relatively to these functions, thereby procuring them universal validity, and by means of them making judgments of experience in general possible.',
    'Such an insight into the nature of the categories, which limits them at the same time to the mere use of experience, never occurred either to their first author, or to any of his successors; but without this insight (which immediately depends upon their derivation or deduction), they are quite useless and only a miserable list of names, without explanation or rule for their use. Had the ancients ever conceived such a notion, doubtless the whole study of the pure rational knowledge, which under the name of metaphysics has for centuries spoiled many a sound mind, would have reached us in quite another shape, and would have enlightened the human understanding, instead of actually exhausting it in obscure and vain speculations, thereby rendering it unfit for true science.',
    'This system of categories makes all treatment of every object of pure reason itself systematic, and affords a direction or clue how and through what points of inquiry every metaphysical consideration must proceed, in order to be complete; for it exhausts all the possible movements (momenta) of the understanding, among which every concept must be classed. In like manner the table of Principles has been formulated, the completeness of which we can only vouch for by the system of the categories. Even in the division of the concepts,25 which must go beyond the physical application of the understanding, it is always the very same clue, which, as it must always be determined a priori by the same fixed points of the human understanding, always forms a closed circle. There is no doubt that the object of a pure conception either of the understanding or of reason, so far as it is to be estimated philosophically and on a priori principles, can in this way be completely cognised. I could not therefore omit to make use of this clue with regard to one of the most abstract ontological divisions, viz., the various distinctions of "the notions of something and of nothing," and to construct accordingly (Critique, p. 207) a regular and necessary table of their divisions.26',
    'And this system, like every other true one founded on a universal principle, shows its inestimable value in this, that it excludes all foreign concepts, which might otherwise intrude among the pure concepts of the understanding, and determines the place of every cognition. Those concepts, which under the name of "concepts of reflexion" have been likewise arranged in a table according to the clue of the categories, intrude, without having any privilege or title to be among the pure concepts of the understanding in Ontology. They are concepts of connexion, and thereby of the objects themselves, whereas the former are only concepts of a mere comparison of concepts already given, hence of quite another nature and use. By my systematic division27 they are saved from this confusion. But the value of my special table of the categories will be still more obvious, when we separate the table of the transcendental concepts of Reason from the concepts of the understanding. The latter being of quite another nature and origin, they must have quite another form than the former. This so necessary separation has never yet been made in any system of metaphysics for, as a rule, these rational concepts all mixed up with the categories, like children of one family, which confusion was unavoidable in the absence of a definite system of categories.',
    'THIRD PART OF THE MAIN TRANSCENDENTAL PROBLEM.',
    'HOW IS METAPHYSICS IN GENERAL POSSIBLE?',
    '§ 40.',
    'PURE mathematics and pure science of nature had no occasion for such a deduction, as we have made of both, for their own safety and certainty. For the former rests upon its own evidence; and the latter (though sprung from pure sources of the understanding) upon experience and its thorough confirmation. Physics cannot altogether refuse and dispense with the testimony of the latter; because with all its certainty, it can never, as philosophy, rival mathematics. Both sciences therefore stood in need of this inquiry, not for themselves, but for the sake of another science, metaphysics.',
    'Metaphysics has to do not only with concepts of nature, which always find their application in experience, but also with pure rational concepts, which never can be given in any possible experience. Consequently the objective reality of these concepts (viz., that they are not mere chimeras), and the truth or falsity of metaphysical assertions, cannot be discovered or confirmed by any experience. This part of metaphysics however is precisely what constitutes its essential end, to which the rest is only a means, and thus this science is in need of such a deduction for its own sake. The third question now proposed relates therefore as it were to the root and essential difference of metaphysics, i.e., the occupation of Reason with itself, and the supposed knowledge of objects arising immediately from this incubation of its own concepts, without requiring, or indeed being able to reach that knowledge through, experience.28',
    'Without solving this problem reason never is justified. The empirical use to which reason limits the pure understanding, does not fully satisfy the proper destination of the latter. Every single experience is only a part of the whole sphere of its domain, but the absolute totality of all possible experience is itself not experience. Yet it is a necessary [concrete] problem for reason, the mere representation of which requires concepts quite different from the categories, whose use is only immanent, or refers to experience, so far as it can be given. Whereas the concepts of reason aim at the completeness, i.e., the collective unity of all possible experience, and thereby transcend every given experience. Thus they become transcendent.',
    'As the understanding stands in need of categories for experience, reason contains in itself the source of ideas, by which I mean necessary concepts, whose object cannot be given in any experience. The latter are inherent in the nature of reason, as the former are in that of the understanding. While the former carry with them an illusion likely to mislead, the illusion of the latter is inevitable, though it certainly can be kept from misleading us.',
    'Since all illusion consists in holding the subjective ground of our judgments to be objective, a self-knowledge of pure reason in its transcendent (exaggerated) use is the sole preservative from the aberrations into which reason falls when it mistakes its destination, and refers that to the object transcendently, which only regards its own subject and its guidance in all immanent use.',
    '§ 41.  The distinction of ideas, that is, of pure concepts of reason, from categories, or pure concepts of the understanding, as cognitions of a quite distinct species, origin and use, is so important a point in founding a science which is to contain the system of all these a priori cognitions, that without this distinction metaphysics is absolutely impossible, or is at best a random, bungling attempt to build a castle in the air without a knowledge of the materials or of their fitness for any purpose. Had the Critique of Pure Reason done nothing but first point out this distinction, it had thereby contributed more to clear up our conception of, and to guide our inquiry in, the field of metaphysics, than all the vain efforts which have hitherto been made to satisfy the transcendent problems of pure reason, without ever surmising that we were in quite another field than that of the understanding, and hence classing concepts of the understanding and those of reason together, as if they were of the same kind.',
    '§ 42.  All pure cognitions of the understanding have this feature, that their concepts present themselves in experience, and their principles can be confirmed by it; whereas the transcendent cognitions of reason cannot, either as ideas, appear in experience, or as propositions ever be confirmed or refuted by it. Hence whatever errors may slip in unawares, can only be discovered by pure reason itself—a discovery of much difficulty, because this very reason naturally becomes dialectical by means of its ideas, and this unavoidable illusion cannot be limited by any objective and dogmatical researches into things, but by a subjective investigation of reason itself as a source of ideas.',
    '§ 43.  In the Critique of Pure Reason it was always my greatest care to endeavor not only carefully to distinguish the several species of cognition, but to derive concepts belonging to each one of them from their common source. I did this in order that by knowing whence they originated, I might determine their use with safety, and also have the unanticipated but invaluable advantage of knowing the completeness of my enumeration, classification and specification of concepts a priori, and therefore according to principles. Without this, metaphysics is mere rhapsody, in which no one knows whether he has enough, or whether and where something is still wanting. We can indeed have this advantage only in pure philosophy, but of this philosophy it constitutes the very essence.',
    'As I had found the origin of the categories in the four logical functions of all the judgments of the understanding, it was quite natural to seek the origin of the ideas in the three functions of the syllogisms of reason. For as soon as these pure concepts of reason (the transcendental ideas) are given, they could hardly, except they be held innate, be found anywhere else, than in the same activity of reason, which, so far as it regards mere form, constitutes the logical element of the syllogisms of reason; but, so far as it represents judgments of the understanding with respect to the one or to the other form a priori, constitutes transcendental concepts of pure reason.',
    'The formal distinction of syllogisms renders their division into categorical, hypothetical, and disjunctive necessary. The concepts of reason founded on them contained therefore, first, the idea of the complete subject (the substantial); secondly, the idea of the complete series of conditions; thirdly, the determination of all concepts in the idea of a complete complex of that which is possible.29 The first idea is psychological, the second cosmological, the third theological, and, as all three give occasion to Dialectics, yet each in its own way, the division of the whole Dialects of pure reason into its Paralogism, its Antinomy, and its Ideal, was arranged accordingly. Through this deduction we may feel assured that all the claims of pure reason are completely represented, and that none can be wanting; because the faculty of reason itself, whence they all take their origin, is thereby completely surveyed.',
    '§ 44.  In these general considerations it is also remarkable that the ideas of reason are unlike the categories, of no service to the use of our understanding in experience, but quite dispensable, and become even an impediment to the maxims of a rational cognition of nature. Yet in another aspect still to be determined they are necessary. Whether the soul is or is not a simple substance, is of no consequence to us in the explanation of its phenomena. For we cannot render the notion of a simple being intelligible by any possible experience that is sensuous or concrete. The notion is therefore quite void as regards all hoped-for insight into the cause of phenomena, and cannot at all serve as a principle of the explanation of that which internal or external experience supplies. So the cosmological ideas of the beginning of the world or of its eternity (a parte ante) cannot be of any greater service to us for the explanation of any event in the world itself. And finally we must, according to a right maxim of the philosophy of nature, refrain from all explanations of the design of nature, drawn from the will of a Supreme Being; because this would not be natural philosophy, but an acknowledgment that we have come to the end of it. The use of these ideas, therefore, is quite different from that of those categories by which (and by the principles built upon which) experience itself first becomes possible. But our laborious analytics of the understanding would be superfluous if we had nothing else in view than the mere cognition of nature as it can be given in experience; for reason does its work, both in mathematics and in the science of nature, quite safely and well without any of this subtle deduction. Therefore our Critique of the Understanding combines with the ideas of pure reason for a purpose which lies beyond the empirical use of the understanding; but this we have above declared to be in this aspect totally inadmissible, and without any object or meaning. Yet there must be a harmony between that of the nature of reason and that of the understanding, and the former must contribute to the perfection of the latter, and cannot possibly upset it.',
    'The solution of this question is as follows: Pure reason does not in its ideas point to particular objects, which lie beyond the field of experience, but only requires completeness of the use of the understanding in the system of experience. But this completeness can be a completeness of principles only, not of intuitions (i.e., concrete atsights or Anschauungen) and of objects. In order however to represent the ideas definitely, reason conceives them after the fashion of the cognition of an object. The cognition is as far as these rules are concerned completely determined, but the object is only an idea invented for the purpose of bringing the cognition of the understanding as near as possible to the completeness represented by that idea.',
    'Prefatory Remark to the Dialectics of Pure Reason.',
    '§ 45.  We have above shown in §§ 33 and 34 that the purity of the categories from all admixture of sensuous determinations may mislead reason into extending their use, quite beyond all experience, to things in themselves; though as these categories themselves find no intuition which can give them meaning or sense in concreto, they, as mere logical functions, can represent a thing in general, but not give by themselves alone a determinate concept of anything. Such hyperbolical objects are distinguised by the appellation of Noümena, or pure beings of the understanding (or better, beings of thought), such as, for example, "substance," but conceived without permanence in time, or "cause," but not acting in time, etc. Here predicates, that only serve to make the conformity-to-law of experience possible, are applied to these concepts, and yet they are deprived of all the conditions of intuition, on which alone experience is possible, and so these concepts lose all significance.',
    'There is no danger, however, of the understanding spontaneously making an excursion so very wantonly beyond its own bounds into the field of the mere creatures of thought, without being impelled by foreign laws. But when reason, which cannot be fully satisfied with any empirical use of the rules of the understanding, as being always conditioned, requires a completion of this chain of conditions, then the understanding is forced out of its sphere. And then it partly represents objects of experience in a series so extended that no experience can grasp, partly even (with a view to complete the series) it seeks entirely beyond it noumena, to which it can attach that chain, and so, having at last escaped from the conditions of experience, make its attitude as it were final. These are then the transcendental ideas, which, though according to the true but hidden ends of the natural determination of our reason, they may aim not at extravagant concepts, but at an unbounded extension of their empirical use, yet seduce the understanding by an unavoidable illusion to a transcendent use, which, though deceitful, cannot be restrained within the bounds of experience by any resolution, but only by scientific instruction and with much difficulty.',
    'I.  The Psychological Idea.30',
    '§ 46.  People have long since observed, that in all substances the proper subject, that which remains after all the accidents (as predicates) are abstracted, consequently that which forms the substance of things remains unknown, and various complaints have been made concerning these limits to our knowledge. But it will be well to consider that the human understanding is not to be blamed for its inability to know the substance of things, that is, to determine it by itself, but rather for requiring to cognise it which is a mere idea definitely as though it were a given object. Pure reason requires us to seek for every predicate of a thing its proper subject, and for this subject, which is itself necessarily nothing but a predicate, its subject, and so on indefinitely (or as far as we can reach). But hence it follows, that we must not hold anything, at which we can arrive, to be an ultimate subject, and that substance itself never can be thought by our understanding, however deep we may penetrate, even if all nature were unveiled to us. For the specific nature of our understanding consists in thinking everything discursively, that is, representing it by concepts, and so by mere predicates, to which therefore the absolute subject must always be wanting. Hence all the real properties, by which we cognise bodies, are mere accidents, not excepting impenetrability, which we can only represent to ourselves as the effect of a power of which the subject is unknown to us.',
    'Now we appear to have this substance in the consciousness of ourselves (in the thinking subject), and indeed in an immediate intuition; for all the predicates of an internal sense refer to the ego, as a subject, and I cannot conceive myself as the predicate of any other subject. Hence completeness in the reference of the given concepts as predicates to a subject—not merely an idea, but an object—that is, the absolute subject itself, seems to be given in experience. But this expectation is disappointed. For the ego is not a concept,31 but only the indication of the object of the internal sense, so far as we cognise it by no further predicate. Consequently it cannot be in itself a predicate of any other thing; but just as little can it be a determinate concept of an absolute subject, but is, as in all other cases, only the reference of the internal phenomena to their unknown subject. Yet this idea (which serves very well, as a regulative principle, totally to destroy all materialistic explanations of the internal phenomena of the soul) occasions by a very natural misunderstanding a very specious argument, which, from this supposed cognition of the substance of our thinking being, infers its nature, so far as the knowledge of it falls quite without the complex of experience.',
    '§ 47.  But though we may call this thinking self (the soul) substance, as being the ultimate subject of thinking which cannot be further represented as the predicate of another thing; it remains quite empty and without significance, if permanence—the quality which renders the concept of substances in experience fruitful—cannot be proved of it.',
    'But permanence can never be proved of the concept of a substance, as a thing in itself, but for the purposes of experience only. This is sufficiently shown by the first Analogy of Experience,32 and who ever will not yield to this proof may try for himself whether he can succeed in proving, from the concept of a subject which does not exist itself as the predicate of another thing, that its existence is thoroughly permanent, and that it cannot either in itself or by any natural cause originate or be annihilated. These synthetical a priori propositions can never be proved in themselves, but only in reference to things as objects of possible experience.',
    '§ 48.  If therefore from the concept of the soul as a substance, we would infer its permanence, this can hold good as regards possible experience only, not [of the soul] as a thing in itself and beyond all possible experience. But life is the subjective condition of all our possible experience, consequently we can only infer the permanence of the soul in life; for the death of man is the end of all experience which concerns the soul as an object of experience, except the contrary be proved, which is the very question in hand. The permanence of the soul can therefore only be proved (and no one cares for that) during the life of man, but not, as we desire to do, after death; and for this general reason, that the concept of substance, so far as it is to be considered necessarily combined with the concept of permanence, can be so combined only according to the principles of possible experience, and therefore for the purposes of experience only.33',
    '§ 49.  That there is something real without us which not only corresponds, but must correspond, to our external perceptions, can likewise be proved to be not a connexion of things in themselves, but for the sake of experience. This means that there is something empirical, i.e., some phenomenon in space without us, that admits of a satisfactory proof, for we have nothing to do with other objects than those which belong to possible experience; because objects which cannot be given us in any experience, do not exist for us. Empirically without me is that which appears in space, and space, together with all the phenomena which it contains, belongs to the representations, whose connexion according to laws of experience proves their objective truth, just as the connexion of the phenomena of the internal sense proves the actuality of my soul (as an object of the internal sense). By means of external experience I am conscious of the actuality of bodies, as external phenomena in space, in the same manner as by means of the internal experience I am conscious of the existence of my soul in time, but this soul is only cognised as an object of the internal sense by phenomena that constitute an internal state, and of which the essence in itself, which forms the basis of these phenomena, is unknown. Cartesian idealism therefore does nothing but distinguish external experience from dreaming; and the conformity to law (as a criterion of its truth) of the former, from the irregularity and the false illusion of the latter. In both it presupposes space and time as conditions of the existence of objects, and it only inquires whether the objects of the external senses, which we when awake put in space, are as actually to be found in it, as the object of the internal sense, the soul, is in time; that is, whether experience carries with it sure criteria to distinguish it from imagination. This doubt, however, may be easily disposed of, and we always do so in common life by investigating the connexion of phenomena in both space and time according to universal laws of experience, and we cannot doubt, when the representation of external things throughout agrees therewith, that they constitute truthful experience. Material idealism, in which phenomena are considered as such only according to their connexion in experience, may accordingly be very easily refuted; and it is just as sure an experience, that bodies exist without us (in space), as that I myself exist according to the representation of the internal sense (in time): for the notion without us, only signifies existence in space. However as the Ego in the proposition, "I am," means not only the object of internal intuition (in time), but the subject of consciousness, just as body means not only external intuition (in space), but the thing-in-itself, which is the basis of this phenomenon; [as this is the case] the question, whether bodies (as phenomena of the external sense) exist as bodies apart from my thoughts, may without any hesitation be denied in nature. But the question, whether I myself as a phenomenon of the internal sense (the soul according to empirical psychology) exist apart from my faculty of representation in time, is an exactly similar inquiry, and must likewise be answered in the negative. And in this manner everything, when it is reduced to its true meaning, is decided and certain. The formal (which I have also called transcendental) actually abolishes the material, or Cartesian, idealism. For if space be nothing but a form of my sensibility, it is as a representation in me just as actual as I myself am, and nothing but the empirical truth of the representations in it remains for consideration. But, if this is not the case, if space and the phenomena in it are something existing without us, then all the criteria of experience beyond our perception can never prove the actuality of these objects without us.',
    'II.  The Cosmological Idea.34',
    '§ 50.  This product of pure reason in its transcendent use is its most remarkable curiosity. It serves as a very powerful agent to rouse philosophy from its dogmatic slumber, and to stimulate it to the arduous task of undertaking a Critique of Reason itself.',
    'I term this idea cosmological, because it always takes its object only from the sensible world, and does not use any other than those whose object is given to sense, consequently it remains in this respect in its native home, it does not become transcendent, and is therefore so far not mere idea; whereas, to conceive the soul as a simple substance, already means to conceive such an object (the simple) as cannot be presented to the senses. Yet the cosmological idea extends the connexion of the conditioned with its condition (whether the connexion is mathematical or dynamical) so far, that experience never can keep up with it. It is therefore with regard to this point always an idea, whose object never can be adequately given in any experience.',
    '§ 51.  In the first place, the use of a system of categories becomes here so obvious and unmistakable, that even if there were not several other proofs of it, this alone would sufficiently prove it indispensable in the system of pure reason. There are only four such transcendent ideas, as there are so many classes of categories; in each of which, however, they refer only to the absolute completeness of the series of the conditions for a given conditioned. In analogy to these cosmological ideas there are only four kinds of dialectical assertions of pure reason, which, as they are dialectical, thereby prove, that to each of them, on equally specious principles of pure reason, a contradictory assertion stands opposed. As all the metaphysical art of the most subtile distinction cannot prevent this opposition, it compels the philosopher to recur to the first sources of pure reason itself. This Antinomy, not arbitrarily invented, but founded in the nature of human reason, and hence unavoidable and never ceasing, contains the following four theses together with their antitheses:',
    '1.',
    'Thesis.',
    'The World has, as to Time and Space, a Beginning (limit).',
    'Antithesis.',
    'The World is, as to Time and Space, infinite.',
    '2.',
    'Thesis.',
    'Everything in the World consists of [elements that are] simple.',
    'Antithesis.',
    'There is nothing simple, but everything is composite.',
    '3.',
    'Thesis.',
    'There are in the World Causes through Freedom.',
    'Antithesis.',
    'There is no Liberty, but all is Nature.',
    '4.',
    'Thesis.',
    'In the Series of the World-Causes there is some necessary Being.',
    'Antithesis.',
    'There is Nothing necessary in the World, but in this Series All is incidental.',
    '§ 52.a.  Here is the most singular phenomenon of human reason, no other instance of which can be shown in any other use. If we, as is commonly done, represent to ourselves the appearances of the sensible world as things in themselves, if we assume the principles of their combination as principles universally valid of things in themselves and not merely of experience, as is usually, nay without our Critique, unavoidably done, there arises an unexpected conflict, which never can be removed in the common dogmatical way; because the thesis, as well as the antithesis, can be shown by equally clear, evident, and irresistible proofs—for I pledge myself as to the correctness of all these proofs—and reason therefore perceives that it is divided with itself, a state at which the sceptic rejoices, but which must make the critical philosopher pause and feel ill at ease.',
    '§ 52.b.  We may blunder in various ways in metaphysics without any fear of being detected in falsehood. For we never can be refuted by experience if we but avoid self-contradiction, which in synthetical, though purely fictitious propositions, may be done whenever the concepts, which we connect, are mere ideas, that cannot be given (in their whole content) in experience. For how can we make out by experience, whether the world is from eternity or had a beginning, whether matter is infinitely divisible or consists of simple parts? Such concept cannot be given in any experience, be it ever so extensive, and consequently the falsehood either of the positive or the negative proposition cannot be discovered by this touch-stone.',
    'The only possible way in which reason could have revealed unintentionally its secret Dialectics, falsely announced as Dogmatics, would be when it were made to ground an assertion upon a universally admitted principle, and to deduce the exact contrary with the greatest accuracy of inference from another which is equally granted. This is actually here the case with regard to four natural ideas of reason, whence four assertions on the one side, and as many counter-assertions on the other arise, each consistently following from universally-acknowledged principles. Thus they reveal by the use of these principles the dialectical illusion of pure reason which would otherwise forever remain concealed.',
    'This is therefore a decisive experiment, which must necessarily expose any error lying hidden in the assumptions of reason.35 Contradictory propositions cannot both be false, except the concept, which is the subject of both, is self-contradictory; for example, the propositions, "a square circle is round, and a square circle is not round," are both false. For, as to the former it is false, that the circle is round, because it is quadrangular; and it is likewise false, that it is not round, that is, angular, because it is a circle. For the logical criterion of the impossibility of a concept consists in this, that if we presuppose it, two contradictory propositions both become false; consequently, as no middle between them is conceivable, nothing at all is thought by that concept.',
    '§ 52.c. The first two antinomies, which I call mathematical, because they are concerned with the addition or division of the homogeneous, are founded on such a self-contradictory concept; and hence I explain how it happens, that both the Thesis and Antithesis of the two are false.',
    'When I speak of objects in time and in space, it is not of things in themselves, of which I know nothing, but of things in appearance, that is, of experience, as the particular way of cognising objects which is afforded to man. I must not say of what I think in time or in space, that in itself, and independent of these my thoughts, it exists in space and in time; for in that case I should contradict myself; because space and time, together with the appearances in them, are nothing existing in themselves and outside of my representations, but are themselves only modes of representation, and it is palpably contradictory to say, that a mere mode of representation exists without our representation. Objects of the senses therefore exist only in experience; whereas to give them a self-subsisting existence apart from experience or before it, is merely to represent to ourselves that experience actually exists apart from experience or before it.',
    'Now if I inquire after the quantity of the world, as to space and time, it is equally impossible, as regards all my notions, to declare it infinite or to declare it finite. For neither assertion can be contained in experience, because experience either of an infinite space, or of an infinite time elapsed, or again, of the boundary of the world by a void space, or by an antecedent void time, is impossible; these are mere ideas. This quantity of the world, which is determined in either way, should therefore exist in the world itself apart from all experience. This contradicts the notion of a world of sense, which is merely a complex of the appearances whose existence and connexion occur only in our representations, that is, in experience, since this latter is not an object in itself, but a mere mode of representation. Hence it follows, that as the concept of an absolutely existing world of sense is self-contradictory, the solution of the problem concerning its quantity, whether attempted affirmatively or negatively, is always false.',
    'The same holds good of the second antinomy, which relates to the division of phenomena. For these are mere representations, and the parts exist merely in their representation, consequently in the division, or in a possible experience where they are given, and the division reaches only as far as this latter reaches. To assume that an appearance, e.g., that of body, contains in itself before all experience all the parts, which any possible experience can ever reach, is to impute to a mere appearance, which can exist only in experience, an existence previous to experience. In other words, it would mean that mere representations exist before they can be found in our faculty of representation. Such an assertion is self-contradictory, as also every solution of our misunderstood problem, whether we maintain, that bodies in themselves consist of an infinite number of parts, or of a finite number of simple parts.',
    '§ 53.  In the first (the mathematical) class of antinomies the falsehood of the assumption consists in representing in one concept something self-contradictory as if it were compatible (i.e., an appearance as an object in itself). But, as to the second (the dynamical) class of antinomies, the falsehood of the representation consists in representing as contradictory what is compatible; so that, as in the former case, the opposed assertions are both false, in this case, on the other hand, where they are opposed to one another by mere misunderstanding, they may both be true.',
    'Any mathematical connexion necessarily presupposes homogeneity of what is connected (in the concept of magnitude), while the dynamical one by no means requires the same. When we have to deal with extended magnitudes, all the parts must be homogeneous with one another and with the whole; whereas, in the connexion of cause and effect, homogeneity may indeed likewise be found, but is not necessary; for the concept of causality (by means of which something is posited through something else quite different from it), at all events, does not require it.',
    'If the objects of the world of sense are taken for things in themselves, and the above laws of nature for the laws of things in themselves, the contradiction would be unavoidable. So also, if the subject of freedom were, like other objects, represented as mere appearance, the contradiction would be just as unavoidable, for the same predicate would at once be affirmed and denied of the same kind of object in the same sense. But if natural necessity is referred merely to appearances, and freedom merely to things in themselves, no contradiction arises, if we at once assume, or admit both kinds of causality, however difficult or impossible it may be to make the latter kind conceivable.',
    'As appearance every effect is an event, or something that happens in time; it must, according to the universal law of nature, be preceded by a determination of the causality of its cause (a state), which follows according to a constant law. But this determination of the cause as causality must likewise be something that takes place or happens; the cause must have begun to act, otherwise no succession between it and the effect could be conceived. Otherwise the effect, as well as the causality of the cause, would have always existed. Therefore the determination of the cause to act must also have originated among appearances, and must consequently, as well as its effect, be an event, which must again have its cause, and so on; hence natural necessity must be the condition, on which effective causes are determined. Whereas if freedom is to be a property of certain causes of appearances, it must, as regards these, which are events, be a faculty of starting them spontaneously, that is, without the causality of the cause itself, and hence without requiring any other ground to determine its start. But then the cause, as to its causality, must not rank under time-determinations of its state, that is, it cannot be an appearance, and must be considered a thing in itself, while its effects would be only appearances.36 If without contradiction we can think of the beings of understanding [Verstandeswesen] as exercising such an influence on appearances, then natural necessity will attach to all connexions of cause and effect in the sensuous world, though on the other hand, freedom can be granted to such cause, as is itself not an appearance (but the foundation of appearance). Nature therefore and freedom can without contradiction be attributed to the very same thing, but in different relations—on one side as a phenomenon, on the other as a thing in itself.',
    'We have in us a faculty, which not only stands in connexion with its subjective determining grounds that are the natural causes of its actions, and is so far the faculty of a being that itself belongs to appearances, but is also referred to objective grounds, that are only ideas, so far as they can determine this faculty, a connexion which is expressed by the word ought. This faculty is called reason, and, so far as we consider a being (man) entirely according to this objectively determinable reason, he cannot be considered as a being of sense, but this property is that of a thing in itself, of which we cannot comprehend the possibility—I mean how the ought (which however has never yet taken place) should determine its activity, and can become the cause of actions, whose effect is an appearance in the sensible world. Yet the causality of reason would be freedom with regard to the effects in the sensuous world, so far as we can consider objective grounds, which are themselves ideas, as their determinants. For its action in that case would not depend upon subjective conditions, consequently not upon those of time, and of course not upon the law of nature, which serves to determine them, because grounds of reason give to actions the rule universally, according to principles, without the influence of the circumstances of either time or place.',
    'What I adduce here is merely meant as an example to make the thing intelligible, and does not necessarily belong to our problem, which must be decided from mere concepts, independently of the properties which we meet in the actual world.',
    'Now I may say without contradiction: that all the actions of rational beings, so far as they are appearances (occurring in any experience), are subject to the necessity of nature; but the same actions, as regards merely the rational subject and its faculty of acting according to mere reason, are free. For what is required for the necessity of nature? Nothing more than the determinability of every event in the world of sense according to constant laws, that is, a reference to cause in the appearance; in this process the thing in itself at its foundation and its causality remain unknown. But I say, that the law of nature remains, whether the rational being is the cause of the effects in the sensuous world from reason, that is, through freedom, or whether it does not determine them on grounds of reason. For, if the former is the case, the action is performed according to maxims, the effect of which as appearance is always conform able to constant laws; if the latter is the case, and the action not performed on principles of reason, it is subjected to the empirical laws of the sensibility, and in both cases the effects are connected according to constant laws; more than this we do not require or know concerning natural necessity. But in the former case reason is the cause of these laws of nature, and therefore free; in the latter the effects follow according to mere natural laws of sensibility, because reason does not influence it; but reason itself is not determined on that account by the sensibility, and is therefore free in this case too. Freedom is therefore no hindrance to natural law in appearance, neither does this law abrogate the freedom of the practical use of reason, which is connected with things in themselves, as determining grounds.',
    'Thus practical freedom, viz., the freedom in which reason possesses causality according to objectively determining grounds, is rescued and yet natural necessity is not in the least curtailed with regard to the very same effects, as appearances. The same remarks will serve to explain what we had to say concerning transcendental freedom and its compatibility with natural necessity (in the same subject, but not taken in the same reference). For, as to this, every beginning of the action of a being from objective causes regarded as determining grounds, is always a first start, though the same action is in the series of appearances only a subordinate start, which must be preceded by a state of the cause, which determines it, and is itself determined in the same manner by another immediately preceding. Thus we are able, in rational beings, or in beings generally, so far as their causality is determined in them as things in themselves, to imagine a faculty of beginning from itself a series of states, without falling into contradiction with the laws of nature. For the relation of the action to objective grounds of reason is not a time-relation; in this case that which determines the causality does not precede in time the action, because such determining grounds represent not a reference to objects of sense, e.g., to causes in the appearances, but to determining causes, as things in themselves, which do not rank under conditions of time. And in this way the action, with regard to the causality of reason, can be considered as a first start in respect to the series of appearances, and yet also as a merely subordinate beginning. We may therefore without contradiction consider it in the former aspect as free, but in the latter (in so far as it is merely appearance) as subject to natural necessity.',
    'As to the fourth Antinomy, it is solved in the same way as the conflict of reason with itself in the third. For, provided the cause in the appearance is distinguished from the cause of the appearance (so far as it can be thought as a thing in itself), both propositions are perfectly reconcilable: the one, that there is nowhere in the sensuous world a cause (according to similar laws of causality), whose existence is absolutely necessary; the other, that this world is nevertheless connected with a Necessary Being as its cause (but of another kind and according to another law). The incompatibility of these propositions entirely rests upon the mistake of extending what is valid merely of appearances to things in themselves, and in general confusing both in one concept.',
    '§ 54.  This then is the proposition and this the solution of the whole antinomy, in which reason finds itself involved in the application of its principles to the sensible world. The former alone (the mere proposition) would be a considerable service in the cause of our knowledge of human reason, even though the solution might fail to fully satisfy the reader, who has here to combat a natural illusion, which has been but recently exposed to him, and which he had hitherto always regarded as genuine. For one result at least is unavoidable. As it is quite impossible to prevent this conflict of reason with itself—so long as the objects of the sensible world are taken for things in themselves, and not for mere appearances, which they are in fact—the reader is thereby compelled to examine over again the deduction of all our a priori cognition and the proof which I have given of my deduction in order to come to a decision on the question. This is all I require at present; for when in this occupation he shall have thought himself deep enough into the nature of pure reason, those concepts by which alone the solution of the conflict of reason is possible, will become sufficiently familiar to him. Without this preparation I cannot expect an unreserved assent even from the most attentive reader.',
    'III.  The Theological Idea.37',
    '§ 55.  The third transcendental Idea, which affords matter for the most important, but, if pursued only speculatively, transcendent and thereby dialectical use of reason, is the ideal of pure reason. Reason in this case does not, as with the psychological and the cosmological Ideas, begin from experience, and err by exaggerating its grounds, in striving to attain, if possible, the absolute completeness of their series. It rather totally breaks with experience, and from mere concepts of what constitutes the absolute completeness of a thing in general, consequently by means of the idea of a most perfect primal Being, it proceeds to determine the possibility and therefore the actuality of all other things. And so the mere presupposition of a Being, who is conceived not in the series of experience, yet for the purposes of experience—for the sake of comprehending its connexion, order, and unity—i.e., the idea [the notion of it], is more easily distinguished from the concept of the understanding here, than in the former cases. Hence we can easily expose the dialectical illusion which arises from our making the subjective conditions of our thinking objective conditions of objects themselves, and an hypothesis necessary for the satisfaction of our reason, a dogma. As the observations of the Critique on the pretensions of transcendental theology are intelligible, clear, and decisive, I have nothing more to add on the subject.',
    'General Remark on the Transcendental Ideas.',
    '§ 56.  The objects, which are given us by experience, are in many respects incomprehensible, and many questions, to which the law of nature leads us, when carried beyond a certain point (though quite conformably to the laws of nature), admit of no answer; as for example the question: why substances attract one another? But if we entirely quit nature, or in pursuing its combinations, exceed all possible experience, and so enter the realm of mere ideas, we cannot then say that the object is incomprehensible, and that the nature of things proposes to us insoluble problems. For we are not then concerned with nature or in general with given objects, but with concepts, which have their origin merely in our reason, and with mere creations of thought; and all the problems that arise from our notions of them must be solved, because of course reason can and must give a full account of its own procedure.38 As the psychological, cosmological, and theological Ideas are nothing but pure concepts of reason, which cannot be given in any experience, the questions which reason asks us about them are put to us not by the objects, but by mere maxims of our reason for the sake of its own satisfaction. They must all be capable of satisfactory answers, which is done by showing that they are principles which bring our use of the understanding into thorough agreement, completeness, and synthetical unity, and that they so far hold good of experience only, but of experience as a whole.',
    'Although an absolute whole of experience is impossible, the idea of a whole of cognition according to principles must impart to our knowledge a peculiar kind of unity, that of a system, without which it is nothing but piecework, and cannot be used for proving the existence of a highest purpose (which can only be the general system of all purposes), I do not here refer only to the practical, but also to the highest purpose of the speculative use of reason.',
    'The transcendental Ideas therefore express the peculiar application of reason as a principle of systematic unity in the use of the understanding. Yet if we assume this unity of the mode of cognition to be attached to the object of cognition, if we regard that which is merely regulative to be constitutive, and if we persuade ourselves that we can by means of these Ideas enlarge our cognition transcendently, or far beyond all possible experience, while it only serves to render experience within itself as nearly complete as possible, i.e., to limit its progress by nothing that cannot belong to experience: we suffer from a mere misunderstanding in our estimate of the proper application of our reason and of its principles, and from a Dialectic, which both confuses the empirical use of reason, and also sets reason at variance with itself.',
    'Conclusion.',
    'On the Determination of the Bounds of Pure Reason.',
    '§ 57.  Having adduced the clearest arguments, it would be absurd for us to hope that we can know more of any object, than belongs to the possible experience of it, or lay claim to the least atom of knowledge about anything not assumed to be an object of possible experience, which would determine it according to the constitution it has in itself. For how could we determine anything in this way, since time, space, and the categories, and still more all the concepts formed by empirical experience or perception in the sensible world (Anschauung), have and can have no other use, than to make experience possible. And if this condition is omitted from the pure concepts of the understanding, they do not determine any object, and have no meaning whatever.',
    'But it would be on the other hand a still greater absurdity if we conceded no things in themselves, or set up our experience for the only possible mode of knowing things, our way of beholding (Anschauung) them in space and in time for the only possible way, and our discursive understanding for the archetype of every possible understanding; in fact if we wished to have the principles of the possibility of experience considered universal conditions of things in themselves.',
    "Our principles, which limit the use of reason to possible experience, might in this way become transcendent, and the limits of our reason be set up as limits of the possibility of things in themselves (as Hume's dialogues may illustrate), if a careful critique did not guard the bounds of our reason with respect to its empirical use, and set a limit to its pretensions. Scepticism originally arose from metaphysics and its licentious dialectics. At first it might, merely to favor the empirical use of reason, announce everything that transcends this use as worthless and deceitful; but by and by, when it was perceived that the very same principles that are used in experience, insensibly, and apparently with the same right, led still further than experience extends, then men began to doubt even the propositions of experience. But here there is no danger; for common sense will doubtless always assert its rights. A certain confusion, however, arose in science which cannot determine how far reason is to be trusted, and why only so far and no further, and this confusion can only be cleared up and all future relapses obviated by a formal determination, on principle, of the boundary of the use of our reason.",
    'We cannot indeed, beyond all possible experience, form a definite notion of what things in themselves may be. Yet we are not at liberty to abstain entirely from inquiring into them; for experience never satisfies reason fully, but in answering questions, refers us further and further back, and leaves us dissatisfied with regard to their complete solution. This any one may gather from the Dialectics of pure reason, which therefore has its good subjective grounds. Having acquired, as regards the nature of our soul, a clear conception of the subject, and having come to the conviction, that its manifestations cannot be explained materialistically, who can refrain from asking what the soul really is, and, if no concept of experience suffices for the purpose, from accounting for it by a concept of reason (that of a simple immaterial being), though we cannot by any means prove its objective reality? Who can satisfy himself with mere empirical knowledge in all the cosmological questions of the duration and of the quantity of the world, of freedom or of natural necessity, since every answer given on principles of experience begets a fresh question, which likewise requires its answer and thereby clearly shows the insufficiency of all physical modes of explanation to satisfy reason? Finally, who does not see in the thorough-going contingency and dependence of all his thoughts and assumptions on mere principles of experience, the impossibility of stopping there? And who does not feel himself compelled, notwithstanding all interdictions against losing himself in transcendent ideas, to seek rest and contentment beyond all the concepts which he can vindicate by experience, in the concept of a Being, the possibility of which we cannot conceive, but at the same time cannot be refuted, because it relates to a mere being of the understanding, and without it reason must needs remain forever dissatisfied?',
    'Bounds (in extended beings) always presuppose a space existing outside a certain definite place, and in closing it; limits do not require this, but are mere negations, which affect a quantity, so far as it is not absolutely complete. But our reason, as it were, sees in its surroundings a space for the cognition of things in themselves, though we can never have definite notions of them, and are limited to appearances only.',
    'As long as the cognition of reason is homogeneous, definite bounds to it are inconceivable. In mathematics and in natural philosophy human reason admits of limits, but not of bounds, viz., that something indeed lies without it, at which it can never arrive, but not that it will at any point find completion in its internal progress. The enlarging of our views in mathematics, and the possibility of new discoveries, are infinite; and the same is the case with the discovery of new properties of nature, of new powers and laws, by continued experience and its rational combination. But limits cannot be mistaken here, for mathematics refers to appearances only, and what cannot be an object of sensuous contemplation, such as the concepts of metaphysics and of morals, lies entirely without its sphere, and it can never lead to them; neither does it require them. It is therefore not a continual progress and an approximation towards these sciences, and there is not, as it were, any point or line of contact. Natural science will never reveal to us the internal constitution of things, which though not appearance, yet can serve as the ultimate ground of explaining appearance. Nor does that science require this for its physical explanations. Nay even if such grounds should be offered from other sources (for instance, the influence of immaterial beings), they must be rejected and not used in the progress of its explanations. For these explanations must only be grounded upon that which as an object of sense can belong to experience, and be brought into connexion with our actual perceptions and empirical laws.',
    'But metaphysics leads us towards bounds in the dialectical attempts of pure reason (not undertaken arbitrarily or wantonly, but stimulated thereto by the nature of reason itself). And the transcendental Ideas, as they do not admit of evasion, and are never capable of realisation, serve to point out to us actually not only the bounds of the pure use of reason, but also the way to determine them. Such is the end and the use of this natural predisposition of our reason, which has brought forth metaphysics as its favorite child, whose generation, like every other in the world, is not to be ascribed to blind chance, but to an original germ, wisely organised for great ends. For metaphysics, in its fundamental features, perhaps more than any other science, is placed in us by nature itself, and cannot be considered the production of an arbitrary choice or a casual enlargement in the progress of experience from which it is quite disparate.',
    'Reason with all its concepts and laws of the understanding, which suffice for empirical use, i.e., within the sensible world, finds in itself no satisfaction because ever-recurring questions deprive us of all hope of their complete solution. The transcendental ideas, which have that completion in view, are such problems of reason. But it sees clearly, that the sensuous world cannot contain this completion, neither consequently can all the concepts, which serve merely for understanding the world of sense, such as space and time, and whatever we have adduced under the name of pure concepts of the understanding. The sensuous world is nothing but a chain of appearances connected according to universal laws; it has therefore no subsistence by itself; it is not the thing in itself, and consequently must point to that which contains the basis of this experience, to beings which cannot be cognised merely as phenomena, but as things in themselves. In the cognition of them alone reason can hope to satisfy its desire of completeness in proceeding from the conditioned to its conditions.',
    'We have above (§§ 33, 34) indicated the limits of reason with regard to all cognition of mere creations of thought. Now, since the transcendental ideas have urged us to approach them, and thus have led us, as it were, to the spot where the occupied space (viz., experience) touches the void (that of which we can know nothing, viz., noumena), we can determine the bounds of pure reason. For in all bounds there is something positive (e.g., a surface is the boundary of corporeal space, and is therefore itself a space, a line is a space, which is the boundary of the surface, a point the boundary of the line, but yet always a place in space), whereas limits contain mere negations. The limits pointed out in those paragraphs are not enough after we have discovered that beyond them there still lies something (though we can never cognise what it is in itself). For the question now is, What is the attitude of our reason in this connexion of what we know with what we do not, and never shall, know? This is an actual connexion of a known thing with one quite unknown (and which will always remain so), and though what is unknown should not become the least more known—which we cannot even hope—yet the notion of this connexion must be definite, and capable of being rendered distinct.',
    'We must therefore accept an immaterial being, a world of understanding, and a Supreme Being (all mere noumena), because in them only, as things in themselves, reason finds that completion and satisfaction, which it can never hope for in the derivation of appearances from their homogeneous grounds, and because these actually have reference to something distinct from them (and totally heterogeneous), as appearances always presuppose an object in itself, and therefore suggest its existence whether we can know more of it or not.',
    'But as we can never cognise these beings of understanding as they are in themselves, that is, definitely, yet must assume them as regards the sensible world, and connect them with it by reason, we are at least able to think this connexion by means of such concepts as express their relation to the world of sense. Yet if we represent to ourselves a being of the understanding by nothing but pure concepts of the understanding, we then indeed represent nothing definite to ourselves, consequently our concept has no significance; but if we think it by properties borrowed from the sensuous world, it is no longer a being of understanding, but is conceived as an appearance, and belongs to the sensible world. Let us take an instance from the notion of the Supreme Being.',
    'Our deistic conception is quite a pure concept of reason, but represents only a thing containing all realities, without being able to determine any one of them; because for that purpose an example must be taken from the world of sense, in which case we should have an object of sense only, not something quite heterogeneous, which can never be an object of sense. Suppose I attribute to the Supreme Being understanding, for instance; I have no concept of an understanding other than my own, one that must receive its perceptions (Anschauung) by the senses, and which is occupied in bringing them under rules of the unity of consciousness. Then the elements of my concept would always lie in the appearance; I should however by the insufficiency of the appearance be necessitated to go beyond them to the concept of a being which neither depends upon appearance, nor is bound up with them as conditions of its determination. But if I separate understanding from sensibility to obtain a pure understanding, then nothing remains but the mere form of thinking without perception (Anschauung), by which form alone I can cognise nothing definite, and consequently no object. For that purpose I should conceive another understanding, such as would directly perceive its objects,39 but of which I have not the least notion; because the human understanding is discursive, and can [not directly perceive, it can] only cognise by means of general concepts. And the very same difficulties arise if we attribute a will to the Supreme Being; for we have this concept only by drawing it from our internal experience, and therefore from our dependence for satisfaction upon objects whose existence we require; and so the notion rests upon sensibility, which is absolutely incompatible with the pure concept of the Supreme Being.',
    "Hume's objections to deism are weak, and affect only the proofs, and not the deistic assertion itself. But as regards theism, which depends on a stricter determination of the concept of the Supreme Being which in deism is merely transcendent, they are very strong, and as this concept is formed, in certain (in fact in all common) cases irrefutable. Hume always insists, that by the mere concept of an original being, to which we apply only ontological predicates (eternity, omnipresence, omnipotence), we think nothing definite, and that properties which can yield a concept in concreto must be superadded; that it is not enough to say, it is Cause, but we must explain the nature of its causality, for example, that of an understanding and of a will. He then begins his attacks on the essential point itself, i.e., theism, as he had previously directed his battery only against the proofs of deism, an attack which is not very dangerous to it in its consequences. All his dangerous arguments refer to anthropomorphism, which he holds to be inseparable from theism, and to make it absurd in itself; but if the former be abandoned, the latter must vanish with it, and nothing remain but deism, of which nothing can come, which is of no value, and which cannot serve as any foundation to religion or morals. If this anthropomorphism were really unavoidable, no proofs whatever of the existence of a Supreme Being, even were they all granted, could determine for us the concept of this Being without involving us in contradictions.",
    'If we connect with the command to avoid all transcendent judgments of pure reason, the command (which apparently conflicts with it) to proceed to concepts that lie beyond the field of its immanent (empirical) use, we discover that both can subsist together, but only at the boundary of all lawful use of reason. For this boundary belongs as well to the field of experience, as to that of the creations of thought, and we are thereby taught, as well, how these so remarkable ideas serve merely for marking the bounds of human reason. On the one hand they give warning not boundlessly to extend cognition of experience, as if nothing but world40 remained for us to cognise, and yet, on the other hand, not to transgress the bounds of experience, and to think of judging about things beyond them, as things in themselves.',
    'But we stop at this boundary if we limit our judgment merely to the relation which the world may have to a Being whose very concept lies beyond all the knowledge which we can attain within the world. For we then do not attribute to the Supreme Being any of the properties in themselves, by which we represent objects of experience, and thereby avoid dogmatic anthropomorphism; but we attribute them to his relation to the world, and allow ourselves a symbolical anthropomorphism, which in fact concerns language only, and not the object itself.',
    'If I say that we are compelled to consider the world, as if it were the work of a Supreme Understanding and Will, I really say nothing more, than that a watch, a ship, a regiment, bears the same relation to the watchmaker, the shipbuilder, the commanding officer, as the world of sense (or whatever constitutes the substratum of this complex of appearances) does to the Unknown, which I do not hereby cognise as it is in itself, but as it is for me or in relation to the world, of which I am a part.',
    '§ 58.  Such a cognition is one of analogy, and does not signify (as is commonly understood) an imperfect similarity of two things, but a perfect similarity of relations between two quite dissimilar things.41 By means of this analogy, however, there remains a concept of the Supreme Being sufficiently determined for us, though we have left out everything that could deter mine it absolutely or in itself; for we determine it as regards the world and as regards ourselves, and more do we not require. The attacks which Hume makes upon those who would determine this concept absolutely, by taking the materials for so doing from themselves and the world, do not affect us; and he cannot object to us, that we have nothing left if we give up the objective anthropomorphism of the concept of the Supreme Being.',
    'For let us assume at the outset (as Hume in his dialogues makes Philo grant Cleanthes), as a necessary hypothesis, the deistical concept of the First Being, in which this Being is thought by the mere ontological predicates of substance, of cause, etc. This must be done, because reason, actuated in the sensible world by mere conditions, which are themselves always conditional, cannot otherwise have any satisfaction, and it therefore can be done without falling into anthropomorphism (which transfers predicates from the world of sense to a Being quite distinct from the world), because those predicates are mere categories, which, though they do not give a determinate concept of God, yet give a concept not limited to any conditions of sensibility. Thus nothing can prevent our predicating of this Being a causality through reason with regard to the world, and thus passing to theism, without being obliged to attribute to God in himself this kind of reason, as a property inhering in him. For as to the former, the only possible way of prosecuting the use of reason (as regards all possible experience, in complete harmony with itself) in the world of sense to the highest point, is to assume a supreme reason as a cause of all the connexions in the world. Such a principle must be quite advantageous to reason and can hurt it nowhere in its application to nature. As to the latter, reason is thereby not transferred as a property to the First Being in himself, but only to his relation to the world of sense, and so anthropomorphism is entirely avoided. For nothing is considered here but the cause of the form of reason which is perceived everywhere in the world, and reason is attributed to the Supreme Being, so far as it contains the ground of this form of reason in the world, but according to analogy only, that is, so far as this expression shows merely the relation, which the Supreme Cause unknown to us has to the world, in order to determine everything in it conformably to reason in the highest degree. We are thereby kept from using reason as an attribute for the purpose of conceiving God, but instead of conceiving the world in such a manner as is necessary to have the greatest possible use of reason according to principle. We thereby acknowledge that the Supreme Being is quite inscrutable and even unthinkable in any definite way as to what he is in himself. We are thereby kept, on the one hand, from making a transcendent use of the concepts which we have of reason as an efficient cause (by means of the will), in order to determine the Divine Nature by properties, which are only borrowed from human nature, and from losing ourselves in gross and extravagant notions, and on the other hand from deluging the contemplation of the world with hyperphysical modes of explanation according to our notions of human reason, which we transfer to God, and so losing for this contemplation its proper application, according to which it should be a rational study of mere nature, and not a presumptuous derivation of its appearances from a Supreme Reason. The expression suited to our feeble notions is, that we conceive the world as if it came, as to its existence and internal plan, from a Supreme Reason, by which notion we both cognise the constitution, which belongs to the world itself, yet without pretending to determine the nature of its cause in itself, and on the other hand, we transfer the ground of this constitution (of the form of reason in the world) upon the relation of the Supreme Cause to the world, without finding the world sufficient by itself for that purpose.42',
    'Thus the difficulties which seem to oppose theism disappear by combining with Hume\'s principle—"not to carry the use of reason dogmatically beyond the field of all possible experience"—this other principle, which he quite overlooked: "not to consider the field of experience as one which bounds itself in the eye of our reason." The Critique of Pure Reason here points out the true mean between dogmatism, which Hume combats, and skepticism, which he would substitute for it—a mean which is not like other means that we find advisable to determine for ourselves as it were mechanically (by adopting something from one side and something from the other), and by which nobody is taught a better way, but such a one as can be accurately determined on principles.',
    '§ 59.  At the beginning of this annotation I made use of the metaphor of a boundary, in order to establish the limits of reason in regard to its suitable use. The world of sense contains merely appearances, which are not things in themselves, but the understanding must assume these latter ones, viz., noumena. In our reason both are comprised, and the question is, How does reason proceed to set boundaries to the understanding as regards both these fields? Experience, which contains all that belongs to the sensuous world, does not bound itself; it only proceeds in every case from the conditioned to some other equally conditioned object. Its boundary must lie quite without it, and this field is that of the pure beings of the understanding. But this field, so far as the determination of the nature of these beings is concerned, is an empty space for us, and if dogmatically-determined concepts alone are in question, we cannot pass out of the field of possible experience. But as a boundary itself is something positive, which belongs as well to that which lies within, as to the space that lies without the given complex, it is still an actual positive cognition, which reason only acquires by enlarging itself to this boundary, yet without attempting to pass it; because it there finds itself in the presence of an empty space, in which it can conceive forms of things, but not things themselves. But the setting of a boundary to the field of the understanding by something, which is otherwise unknown to it, is still a cognition which belongs to reason even at this standpoint, and by which it is neither confined within the sensible, nor straying without it, but only refers, as befits the knowledge of a boundary, to the relation between that which lies without it, and that which is contained within it.',
    'Natural theology is such a concept at the boundary of human reason, being constrained to look beyond this boundary to the Idea of a Supreme Being (and, for practical purposes to that of an intelligible world also), not in order to determine anything relatively to this pure creation of the understanding, which lies beyond the world of sense, but in order to guide the use of reason within it according to principles of the greatest possible (theoretical as well as practical) unity. For this purpose we make use of the reference of the world of sense to an independent reason, as the cause of all its connexions. Thereby we do not purely invent a being, but, as beyond the sensible world there must be something that can only be thought by the pure understanding, we determine that something in this particular way, though only of course according to analogy.',
    'And thus there remains our original proposition, which is the résumé of the whole Critique: "that reason by all its a priori principles never teaches us anything more than objects of possible experience, and even of these nothing more than can be cognised in experience." But this limitation does not prevent reason leading us to the objective boundary of experience, viz., to the reference to something which is not itself an object of experience, but is the ground of all experience. Reason does not however teach us anything concerning the thing in itself: it only instructs us as regards its own complete and highest use in the field of possible experience. But this is all that can be reasonably desired in the present case, and with which we have cause to be satisfied.',
    '§ 60. Thus we have fully exhibited metaphysics as it is actually given in the natural predisposition of human reason, and in that which constitutes the essential end of its pursuit, according to its subjective possibility. Though we have found, that this merely natural use of such a predisposition of our reason, if no discipline arising only from a scientific critique bridles and sets limits to it, involves us in transcendent, either apparently or really conflicting, dialectical syllogisms; and this fallacious metaphysics is not only unnecessary as regards the promotion of our knowledge of nature, but even disadvantageous to it: there yet remains a problem worthy of solution, which is to find out the natural ends intended by this disposition to transcendent concepts in our reason, because everything that lies in nature must be originally intended for some useful purpose.',
    'Such an inquiry is of a doubtful nature; and I acknowledge, that what I can say about it is conjecture only, like every speculation about the first ends of nature. The question does not concern the objective validity of metaphysical judgments, but our natural predisposition to them, and therefore does not belong to the system of metaphysics but to anthropology.',
    'When I compare all the transcendental Ideas, the totality of which constitutes the particular problem of natural pure reason, compelling it to quit the mere contemplation of nature, to transcend all possible experience, and in this endeavor to produce the thing (be it knowledge or fiction) called metaphysics, I think I perceive that the aim of this natural tendency is, to free our notions from the fetters of experience and from the limits of the mere contemplation of nature so far as at least to open to us a field containing mere objects for the pure understanding, which no sensibility can reach, not indeed for the purpose of speculatively occupying ourselves with them (for there we can find no ground to stand on), but because practical principles, which, without finding some such scope for their necessary expectation and hope, could not expand to the universality which reason unavoidably requires from a moral point of view.',
    'So I find that the Psychological Idea (however little it may reveal to me the nature of the human soul, which is higher than all concepts of experience), shows the insufficiency of these concepts plainly enough, and thereby deters me from materialism, the psychological notion of which is unfit for any explanation of nature, and besides confines reason in practical respects. The Cosmological Ideas, by the obvious insufficiency of all possible cognition of nature to satisfy reason in its lawful inquiry, serve in the same manner to keep us from naturalism, which asserts nature to be sufficient for itself. Finally, all natural necessity in the sensible world is conditional, as it always presupposes the dependence of things upon others, and unconditional necessity must be sought only in the unity of a cause different from the world of sense. But as the causality of this cause, in its turn, were it merely nature, could never render the existence of the contingent (as its consequent) comprehensible, reason frees itself by means of the Theological Idea from fatalism, (both as a blind natural necessity in the coherence of nature itself, without a first principle, and as a blind causality of this principle itself), and leads to the concept of a cause possessing freedom, or of a Supreme Intelligence. Thus the transcendental Ideas serve, if not to instruct us positively, at least to destroy the rash assertions of Materialism, of Naturalism, and of Fatalism, and thus to afford scope for the moral Ideas beyond the field of speculation. These considerations, I should think, explain in some measure the natural predisposition of which I spoke.',
    'The practical value, which a merely speculative science may have, lies without the bounds of this science, and can therefore be considered as a scholion merely, and like all scholia does not form part of the science itself. This application however surely lies within the bounds of philosophy, especially of philosophy drawn from the pure sources of reason, where its speculative use in metaphysics must necessarily be at unity with its practical use in morals. Hence the unavoidable dialectics of pure reason, considered in metaphysics, as a natural tendency, deserves to be explained not as an illusion merely, which is to be removed, but also, if possible, as a natural provision as regards its end, though this duty, a work of supererogation, cannot justly be assigned to metaphysics proper.',
    "The solutions of these questions which are treated in the chapter on the Regulative Use of the Ideas of Pure Reason43 should be considered a second scholion which however has a greater affinity with the subject of metaphysics. For there certain rational principles are expounded which determine a priori the order of nature or rather of the understanding, which seeks nature's laws through experience. They seem to be constitutive and legislative with regard to experience, though they spring from pure reason, which cannot be considered, like the understanding, as a principle of possible experience. Now whether or not this harmony rests upon the fact, that just as nature does not inhere in appearances or in their source (the sensibility) itself, but only in so far as the latter is in relation to the understanding, as also a systematic unity in applying the understanding to bring about an entirety of all possible experience can only belong to the understanding when in relation to reason; and whether or not experience is in this way mediately subordinate to the legislation of reason: may be discussed by those who desire to trace the nature of reason even beyond its use in metaphysics, into the general principles of a history of nature; I have represented this task as important, but not attempted its solution, in the book itself.44",
    'And thus I conclude the analytical solution of the main question which I had proposed: How is metaphysics in general possible? by ascending from the data of its actual use in its consequences, to the grounds of its possibility.',
    'SCHOLIA.',
    'SOLUTION OF THE GENERAL QUESTION OF THE PROLEGOMENA, "HOW IS METAPHYSICS POSSIBLE AS A SCIENCE?"',
    'METAPHYSICS, as a natural disposition of reason, is actual, but if considered by itself alone (as the analytical solution of the third principal question showed), dialectical and illusory. If we think of taking principles from it, and in using them follow the natural, but on that account not less false, illusion, we can never produce science, but only a vain dialectical art, in which one school may outdo another, but none can ever acquire a just and lasting approbation.',
    'In order that as a science metaphysics may be entitled to claim not mere fallacious plausibility, but in sight and conviction, a Critique of Reason must itself exhibit the whole stock of a priori concepts, their division according to their various sources (Sensibility, Understanding, and Reason), together with a complete table of them, the analysis of all these concepts, with all their consequences, especially by means of the deduction of these concepts, the possibility of synthetical cognition a priori, the principles of its application and finally its bounds, all in a complete system. Critique, therefore, and critique alone, contains in itself the whole well-proved and well-tested plan, and even all the means required to accomplish metaphysics, as a science; by other ways and means it is impossible. The question here therefore is not so much how this performance is possible, as how to set it going, and induce men of clear heads to quit their hitherto perverted and fruitless cultivation for one that will not deceive, and how such a union for the common end may best be directed.',
    'This much is certain, that whoever has once tasted Critique will be ever after disgusted with all dogmatical twaddle which he formerly put up with, because his reason must have something, and could find nothing better for its support.',
    'Critique stands in the same relation to the common metaphysics of the schools, as chemistry does to alchemy, or as astronomy to the astrology of the fortune-teller. I pledge myself that nobody who has read through and through, and grasped the principles of, the Critique even in these Prolegomena only, will ever return to that old and sophistical pseudo-science; but will rather with a certain delight look forward to metaphysics which is now indeed in his power, requiring no more preparatory discoveries, and now at last affording permanent satisfaction to reason. For here is an advantage upon which, of all possible sciences, metaphysics alone can with certainty reckon: that it can be brought to such completion and fixity as to be incapable of further change, or of any augmentation by new discoveries; because here reason has the sources of its knowledge in itself, not in objects and their observation (Anschauung), by which latter its stock of knowledge cannot be further increased. When therefore it has exhibited the fundamental laws of its faculty completely and so definitely as to avoid all misunderstanding, there remains nothing for pure reason to cognise a priori, nay, there is even no ground to raise further questions. The sure prospect of knowledge so definite and so compact has a peculiar charm, even though we should set aside all its advantages, of which I shall hereafter speak.',
    'All false art, all vain wisdom, lasts its time, but finally destroys itself, and its highest culture is also the epoch of its decay. That this time is come for metaphysics appears from the state into which it has fallen among all learned nations, despite of all the zeal with which other sciences of every kind are prosecuted. The old arrangement of our university studies still preserves its shadow; now and then an Academy of Science tempts men by offering prizes to write essays on it, but it is no longer numbered among thorough sciences; and let any one judge for himself how a man of genius, if he were called a great metaphysician, would receive the compliment, which may be well-meant, but is scarce envied by anybody.',
    'Yet, though the period of the downfall of all dogmatical metaphysics has undoubtedly arrived, we are yet far from being able to say that the period of its regeneration is come by means of a thorough and complete Critique of Reason. All transitions from a tendency to its contrary pass through the stage of indifference, and this moment is the most dangerous for an author, but, in my opinion, the most favorable for the science. For, when party spirit has died out by a total dissolution of former connexions, minds are in the best state to listen to several proposals for an organisation according to a new plan.',
    'When I say, that I hope these Prolegomena will excite investigation in the field of critique and afford a new and promising object to sustain the general spirit of philosophy, which seems on its speculative side to want sustenance, I can imagine beforehand, that every one, whom the thorny paths of my Critique have tired and put out of humor, will ask me, upon what I found this hope. My answer is, upon the irresistible law of necessity.',
    'That the human mind will ever give up metaphysical researches is as little to be expected as that we should prefer to give up breathing altogether, to avoid inhaling impure air. There will therefore always be metaphysics in the world; nay, every one, especially every man of reflexion, will have it, and for want of a recognised standard, will shape it for himself after his own pattern. What has hitherto been called metaphysics, cannot satisfy any critical mind, but to forego it entirely is impossible; therefore a Critique of Pure Reason itself must now be attempted or, if one exists, investigated, and brought to the full test, because there is no other means of supplying this pressing want, which is something more than mere thirst for knowledge.',
    'Ever since I have come to know critique, whenever I finish reading a book of metaphysical contents, which, by the preciseness of its notions, by variety, order, and an easy style, was not only entertaining but also helpful, I cannot help asking, "Has this author indeed advanced metaphysics a single step?" The learned men, whose works have been useful to me in other respects and always contributed to the culture of my mental powers, will, I hope, forgive me for saying, that I have never been able to find either their essays or my own less important ones (though self-love may recommend them to me) to have advanced the science of metaphysics in the least, and why?',
    'Here is the very obvious reason: metaphysics did not then exist as a science, nor can it be gathered piecemeal, but its germ must be fully preformed in the Critique. But in order to prevent all misconception, we must remember what has been already said, that by the analytical treatment of our concepts the understanding gains indeed a great deal, but the science (of metaphysics) is thereby not in the least advanced, because these dissections of concepts are nothing but the materials from which the intention is to carpenter our science. Let the concepts of substance and of accident be ever so well dissected and determined, all this is very well as a preparation for some future use. But if we cannot prove, that in all which exists the substance endures, and only the accidents vary, our science is not the least advanced by all our analyses.',
    'Metaphysics has hitherto never been able to prove a priori either this proposition, or that of sufficient reason, still, less any more complex theorem, such as belongs to psychology or cosmology, or indeed any synthetical proposition. By all its analysing therefore nothing is affected, nothing obtained or forwarded, and the science, after all this bustle and noise, still remains as it was in the days of Aristotle, though far better preparations were made for it than of old, if the clue to synthetical cognitions had only been discovered.',
    'If any one thinks himself offended, he is at liberty to refute my charge by producing a single synthetical proposition belonging to metaphysics, which he would prove dogmatically a priori, for until he has actually performed this feat, I shall not grant that he has truly advanced the science; even should this proposition be sufficiently confirmed by common experience. No demand can be more moderate or more equitable, and in the (inevitably certain) event of its non-performance, no assertion more just, than that hitherto metaphysics has never existed as a science.',
    'But there are two things which, in case the challenge be accepted, I must deprecate: first, trifling about probability and conjecture, which are suited as little to metaphysics, as to geometry; and secondly, a decision by means of the magic wand of common sense, which does not convince every one, but which accommodates itself to personal peculiarities.',
    'For as to the former, nothing can be more absurd, than in metaphysics, a philosophy from pure reason to think of grounding our judgments upon probability and conjecture. Everything that is to be cognised a priori, is thereby announced as apodeictically certain, and must therefore be proved in this way. We might as well think of grounding geometry or arithmetic upon conjectures. As to the doctrine of chances in the latter, it does not contain probable, but perfectly certain, judgments concerning the degree of the probability of certain cases, under given uniform conditions, which, in the sum of all possible cases, infallibly happen according to the rule, though it is not sufficiently determined in respect to every single chance. Conjectures (by means of induction and of analogy) can be suffered in an empirical science of nature only, yet even there the possibility at least of what we assume must be quite certain.',
    'The appeal to common sense is even more absurd, when concept and principles are announced as valid, not in so far as they hold with regard to experience, but even beyond the conditions of experience. For what is common sense? It is normal good sense, so far it judges right. But what is normal good sense? It is the faculty of the knowledge and use of rules in concreto, as distinguished from the speculative understanding, which is a faculty of knowing rules in abstracto. Common sense can hardly understand the rule, "that every event is determined by means of its cause," and can never comprehend it thus generally. It therefore demands an example from experience, and when it hears that this rule means nothing but what it always thought when a pane was broken or a kitchen-utensil missing, it then understands the principle and grants it. Common sense therefore is only of use so far as it can see its rules (though they actually are a priori) confirmed by experience; consequently to comprehend them a priori, or independently of experience, belongs to the speculative understanding, and lies quite beyond the horizon of common sense. But the province of metaphysics is entirely confined to the latter kind of knowledge, and it is certainly a bad index of common sense to appeal to it as a witness, for it cannot here form any opinion whatever, and men look down upon it with contempt until they are in difficulties, and can find in their speculation neither in nor out.',
    'It is a common subterfuge of those false friends of common sense (who occasionally prize it highly, but usually despise it) to say, that there must surely be at all events some propositions which are immediately certain, and of which there is no occasion to give any proof, or even any account at all, because we otherwise could never stop inquiring into the grounds of our judgments. But if we except the principle of contradiction, which is not sufficient to show the truth of synthetical judgments, they can never adduce, in proof of this privilege, anything else indubitable, which they can immediately ascribe to common sense, except mathematical propositions, such as twice two make four, between two points there is but one straight line, etc. But these judgments are radically different from those of metaphysics. For in mathematics I myself can by thinking construct whatever I represent to myself as possible by a concept: I add to the first two the other two, one by one, and myself make the number four, or I draw in thought from one point to another all manner of lines, equal as well as unequal; yet I can draw one only, which is like itself in all its parts. But I cannot, by all my power of thinking, extract from the concept of a thing the concept of something else, whose existence is necessarily connected with the former, but I must call in experience. And though my understanding furnishes me a priori (yet only in reference to possible experience) with the concept of such a connexion (i.e., causation), I cannot exhibit it, like the concepts of mathematics, by (Anschauung) visualising them, a priori, and so show its possibility a priori. This concept, together with the principles of its application, always requires, if it shall hold a priori—as is requisite in metaphysics—a justification and deduction of its possibility, because we cannot otherwise know how far it holds good, and whether it can be used in experience only or beyond it also.',
    'Therefore in metaphysics, as a speculative science of pure reason, we can never appeal to common sense, but may do so only when we are forced to surrender it, and to renounce all purely speculative cognition, which must always be knowledge, and consequently when we forego metaphysics itself and its instruction, for the sake of adopting a rational faith which alone may be possible for us, and sufficient to our wants, perhaps even more salutary than knowledge itself. For in this case the attitude of the question is quite altered. Metaphysics must be science, not only as a whole, but in all its parts, otherwise it is nothing; because, as a speculation of pure reason, it finds a hold only on general opinions. Beyond its field, however, probability and common sense may be used with advantage and justly, but on quite special principles, of which the importance always depends on the reference to practical life.',
    'This is what I hold myself justified in requiring for the possibility of metaphysics as a science.',
    'APPENDIX.',
    'ON WHAT CAN BE DONE TO MAKE METAPHYSICS ACTUAL AS A SCIENCE.',
    'SINCE all the ways heretofore taken have failed to attain the goal, and since without a preceding critique of pure reason it is not likely ever to be attained, the present essay now before the public has a fair title to an accurate and careful investigation, except it be thought more advisable to give up all pretensions to metaphysics, to which, if men but would consistently adhere to their purpose, no objection can be made.',
    'If we take the course of things as it is, not as it ought to be, there are two sorts of judgments: (1) one a judgment which precedes investigation (in our case one in which the reader from his own metaphysics pronounces judgment on the Critique of Pure Reason which was intended to discuss the very possibility of metaphysics); (2) the other a judgment subsequent to investigation. In the latter the reader is enabled to waive for awhile the consequences of the critical researches that may be repugnant to his formerly adopted metaphysics, and first examines the grounds whence those consequences are derived. If what common metaphysics propounds were demonstrably certain, as for instance the theorems of geometry, the former way of judging would hold good. For if the consequences of certain principles are repugnant to established truths, these principles are false and without further inquiry to be repudiated. But if metaphysics does not possess a stock of indisputably certain (synthetical) propositions, and should it even be the case that there are a number of them, which, though among the most specious, are by their consequences in mutual collision, and if no sure criterion of the truth of peculiarly metaphysical (synthetical) propositions is to be met with in it, then the former way of judging is not admissible, but the investigation of the principles of the critique must precede all judgments as to its value.',
    'ON A SPECIMEN OF A JUDGMENT OF THE CRITIQUE PRIOR TO ITS EXAMINATION.',
    'This judgment is to be found in the Göttingischen gelehrten Anzeigen, in the supplement to the third division, of January 19, 1782, pages 40 et seq.',
    'When an author who is familiar with the subject of his work and endeavors to present his independent reflexions in its elaboration, falls into the hands of a reviewer who, in his turn, is keen enough to discern the points on which the worth or worthlessness of the book rests, who does not cling to words, but goes to the heart of the subject, sifting and testing more than the mere principles which the author takes as his point of departure, the severity of the judgment may indeed displease the latter, but the public does not care, as it gains thereby; and the author himself may be contented, as an opportunity of correcting or explaining his positions is afforded to him at an early date by the examination of a competent judge, in such a manner, that if he believes himself fundamentally right, he can remove in time any stone of offence that might hurt the success of his work.',
    'I find myself, with my reviewer, in quite another position. He seems not to see at all the real matter of the investigation with which (successfully or unsuccessfully) I have been occupied. It is either impatience at thinking out a lengthy work, or vexation at a threatened reform of a science in which he believed he had brought everything to perfection long ago, or, what I am unwilling to imagine, real narrowmindedness, that prevents him from ever carrying his thoughts beyond his school-metaphysics. In short, he passes impatiently in review a long series of propositions, by which, without knowing their premises, we can think nothing, intersperses here and there his censure, the reason of which the reader understands just as little as the propositions against which it is directed; and hence [his report] can neither serve the public nor damage me, in the judgment of experts. I should, for these reasons, have passed over this judgment altogether, were it not that it may afford me occasion for some explanations which may in some cases save the readers of these Prolegomena from a misconception.',
    'In order to take a position from which my reviewer could most easily set the whole work in a most unfavorable light, without venturing to trouble himself with any special investigation, he begins and ends by saying:',
    '"This work is a system of transcendent (or, as he translates it, of higher) Idealism."45',
    'A glance at this line soon showed me the sort of criticism that I had to expect, much as though the reviewer were one who had never seen or heard of geometry, having found a Euclid, and coming upon various figures in turning over its leaves, were to say, on being asked his opinion of it: "The work is a text-book of drawing; the author introduces a peculiar terminology, in order to give dark, incomprehensible directions, which in the end teach nothing more than what every one can effect by a fair natural accuracy of eye, etc."',
    'Let us see, in the meantime, what sort of an idealism it is that goes through my whole work, although it does not by a long way constitute the soul of the system.',
    'The dictum of all genuine idealists from the Eleatic school to Bishop Berkeley, is contained in this formula: "All cognition through the senses and experience is nothing but sheer illusion, and only, in the ideas of the pure understanding and reason there is truth."',
    'The principle that throughout dominates and determines my Idealism, is on the contrary: "All cognition of things merely from pure understanding or pure reason is nothing but sheer illusion, and only in experience is there truth."',
    'But this is directly contrary to idealism proper. How came I then to use this expression for quite an opposite purpose, and how came my reviewer to see it everywhere?',
    'The solution of this difficulty rests on something that could have been very easily understood from the general bearing of the work, if the reader had only desired to do so. Space and time, together with all that they contain, are not things nor qualities in themselves, but belong merely to the appearances of the latter: up to this point I am one in confession with the above idealists. But these, and amongst them more particularly Berkeley, regarded space as a mere empirical presentation that, like the phenomenon it contains, is only known to us by means of experience or perception, together with its determinations. I, on the contrary, prove in the first place, that space (and also time, which Berkeley did not consider) and all its determinations a priori, can be cognised by us, because, no less than time, it inheres in our sensibility as a pure form before all perception or experience and makes all intuition of the same, and therefore all its phenomena, possible. It follows from this, that as truth rests on universal and necessary laws as its criteria, experience, according to Berkeley, can have no criteria of truth, because its phenomena (according to him) have nothing a priori at their foundation; whence it follows, that they are nothing but sheer illusion; whereas with us, space and time (in conjunction with the pure conceptions of the understanding) prescribe their law to all possible experience a priori, and at the same time afford the certain criterion for distinguishing truth from illusion therein.46',
    'My so-called (properly critical) Idealism is of quite a special character, in that it subverts the ordinary idealism, and that through it all cognition a priori, even that of geometry, first receives objective reality, which, without my demonstrated ideality of space and time, could not be maintained by the most zealous realists. This being the state of the case, I could have wished, in order to avoid all misunderstanding, to have named this conception of mine otherwise, but to alter it altogether was impossible. It may be permitted me however, in future, as has been above intimated, to term it the formal, or better still, the critical Idealism, to distinguish it from the dogmatic Idealism of Berkeley, and from the sceptical Idealism of Descartes.',
    "Beyond this, I find nothing further remarkable in the judgment of my book. The reviewer criticises here and there, makes sweeping criticisms, a mode prudently chosen, since it does not betray one's own knowledge or ignorance; a single thorough criticism in detail, had it touched the main question, as is only fair, would have exposed, it may be my error, or it may be my reviewer's measure of insight into this species of research. It was, moreover, not a badly conceived plan, in order at once to take from readers (who are accustomed to form their conceptions of books from newspaper reports) the desire to read the book itself, to pour out in one breath a number of passages in succession, torn from their connexion, and their grounds of proof and explanations, and which must necessarily sound senseless, especially considering how antipathetic they are to all school-metaphysics; to exhaust the reader's patience ad nauseam, and then, after having made me acquainted with the sensible proposition that persistent illusion is truth, to conclude with the crude paternal moralisation: to what end, then, the quarrel with accepted language, to what end, and whence, the idealistic distinction? A judgment which seeks all that is characteristic of my book, first supposed to be metaphysically heterodox, in a mere innovation of the nomenclature, proves clearly that my would-be judge has understood nothing of the subject, and in addition, has not understood himself.47",
    'My reviewer speaks like a man who is conscious of important and superior insight which he keeps hidden; for I am aware of nothing recent with respect to metaphysics that could justify his tone. But he should not withhold his discoveries from the world, for there are doubtless many who, like myself, have not been able to find in all the fine things that have for long past been written in this department, anything that has advanced the science by so much as a fingerbreadth; we find indeed the giving a new point to definitions, the supplying of lame proofs with new crutches, the adding to the crazy-quilt of metaphysics fresh patches or changing its pattern; but all this is not what the world requires. The world is tired of metaphysical assertions; it wants the possibility of the science, the sources from which certainty therein can be derived, and certain criteria by which it may distinguish the dialectical illusion of pure reason from truth. To this the critic seems to possess a key, otherwise he would never have spoken out in such a high tone.',
    'But I am inclined to suspect that no such requirement of the science has ever entered his thoughts, for in that case he would have directed his judgment to this point, and even a mistaken attempt in such an important matter, would have won his respect. If that be the case, we are once more good friends. He may penetrate as deeply as he likes into metaphysics, without any one hindering him; only as concerns that which lies outside metaphysics, its sources, which are to be found in reason, he cannot form a judgment. That my suspicion is not without foundation, is proved by the fact that he does not mention a word about the possibility of synthetic knowledge a priori, the special problem upon the solution of which the fate of metaphysics wholly rests, and upon which my Critique (as well as the present Prolegomena) entirely hinges. The Idealism he encountered, and which he hung upon, was only taken up in the doctrine as the sole means of solving the above problem (although it received its confirmation on other grounds), and hence he must have shown either that the above problem does not possess the importance I attribute to it (even in these Prolegomena), or that by my conception of appearances, it is either not solved at all, or can be better solved in another way; but I do not find a word of this in the criticism. The reviewer, then, understands nothing of my work, and possibly also nothing of the spirit and essential nature of metaphysics itself; and it is not, what I would rather assume, the hurry of a man incensed at the labor of plodding through so many obstacles, that threw an unfavorable shadow over the work lying before him, and made its fundamental features unrecognisable.',
    'There is a good deal to be done before a learned journal, it matters not with what care its writers may be selected, can maintain its otherwise well-merited reputation, in the field of metaphysics as elsewhere. Other sciences and branches of knowledge have their standard. Mathematics has it, in itself; history and theology, in profane or sacred books; natural science and the art of medicine, in mathematics and experience; jurisprudence, in law books; and even matters of taste in the examples of the ancients. But for the judgment of the thing called metaphysics, the standard has yet to be found. I have made an attempt to determine it, as well as its use. What is to be done, then, until it be found, when works of this kind have to be judged of? If they are of a dogmatic character, one may do what one likes; no one will play the master over others here for long, before someone else appears to deal with him in the same manner. If, however, they are critical in their character, not indeed with reference to other works, but to reason itself, so that the standard of judgment cannot be assumed but has first of all to be sought for, then, though objection and blame may indeed be permitted, yet a certain degree of leniency is indispensable, since the need is common to us all, and the lack of the necessary insight makes the high-handed attitude of judge unwarranted.',
    'In order, however, to connect my defence with the interest of the philosophical commonwealth, I propose a test, which must be decisive as to the mode, whereby all metaphysical investigations may be directed to their common purpose. This is nothing more than what formerly mathematicians have done, in establishing the advantage of their methods by competition. I challenge my critic to demonstrate, as is only just, on a priori grounds, in his way, a single really metaphysical principle asserted by him. Being metaphysical it must be synthetic and cognised a priori from conceptions, but it may also be any one of the most indispensable principles, as for instance, the principle of the persistence of substance, or of the necessary determination of events in the world by their causes. If he cannot do this (silence however is confession), he must admit, that as metaphysics without apodeictic certainty of propositions of this kind is nothing at all, its possibility or impossibility must before all things be established in a critique of the pure reason. Thus he is bound either to confess that my principles in the Critique are correct, or he must prove their invalidity. But as I can already foresee, that, confidently as he has hitherto relied on the certainty of his principles, when it comes to a strict test he will not find a single one in the whole range of metaphysics he can bring forward, I will concede to him an advantageous condition, which can only be expected in such a competition, and will relieve him of the onus probandi by laying it on myself.',
    'He finds in these Prolegomena and in my Critique (chapter on the "Theses and Antitheses of the Four Antinomies") eight propositions, of which two and two contradict one another, but each of which necessarily belongs to metaphysics, by which it must either be accepted or rejected (although there is not one that has not in this time been held by some philosopher). Now he has the liberty of selecting any one of these eight propositions at his pleasure, and accepting it without any proof, of which I shall make him a present, but only one (for waste of time will be just as little serviceable to him as to me), and then of attacking my proof of the opposite proposition. If I can save this one, and at the same time show, that according to principles which every dogmatic metaphysics must necessarily recognise, the opposite of the proposition adopted by him can be just as clearly proved, it is thereby established that metaphysics has an hereditary failing, not to be explained, much less set aside, until we ascend to its birth-place, pure reason itself, and thus my Critique must either be accepted or a better one take its place; it must at least be studied, which is the only thing I now require. If, on the other hand, I cannot save my demonstration, then a synthetic proposition a priori from dogmatic principles is to be reckoned to the score of my opponent, then also I will deem my impeachment of ordinary metaphysics as unjust, and pledge myself to recognise his stricture on my Critique as justified (although this would not be the consequence by a long way). To this end it would be necessary, it seems to me, that he should step out of his incognito. Otherwise I do not see how it could be avoided, that instead of dealing with one, I should be honored by several problems coming from anonymous and unqualified opponents.',
    'PROPOSALS AS TO AN INVESTIGATION OF THE CRITIQUE UPON WHICH A JUDGMENT MAY FOLLOW.',
    "I feel obliged to the honored public even for the silence with which it for a long time favored my Critique, for this proves at least a postponement of judgment, and some supposition that in a work, leaving all beaten tracks and striking out on a new path, in which one cannot at once perhaps so easily find one's way, something may perchance lie, from which an important but at present dead branch of human knowledge may derive new life and productiveness. Hence may have originated a solicitude for the as yet tender shoot, lest it be destroyed by a hasty judgment. A test of a judgment, delayed for the above reasons, is now before my eye in the Gothaischen gelehrten Zeitung, the thoroughness of which every reader will himself perceive, from the clear and unperverted presentation of a fragment of one of the first principles of my work, without taking into consideration my own suspicious praise.",
    "And now I propose, since an extensive structure cannot be judged of as a whole from a hurried glance, to test it piece by piece from its foundations, so thereby the present Prolegomena may fitly be used as a general outline with which the work itself may occasionally be compared. This notion, if it were founded on nothing more than my conceit of importance, such as vanity commonly attributes to one's own productions, would be immodest and would deserve to be repudiated with disgust. But now, the interests of speculative philosophy have arrived at the point of total extinction, while human reason hangs upon them with inextinguishable affection, and only after having been ceaselessly deceived does it vainly attempt to change this into indifference.",
    'In our thinking age it is not to be supposed but that many deserving men would use any good opportunity of working for the common interest of the more and more enlightened reason, if there were only some hope of attaining the goal. Mathematics, natural science, laws, arts, even morality, etc., do not completely fill the soul; there is always a space left over, reserved for pure and speculative reason, the vacuity of which prompts us to seek in vagaries, buffooneries, and myticism for what seems to be employment and entertainment, but what actually is mere pastime; in order to deaden the troublesome voice of reason, which in accordance with its nature requires something that can satisfy it, and not merely subserve other ends or the interests of our inclinations. A consideration, therefore, which is concerned only with reason as it exists for it itself, has as I may reasonably suppose a great fascination for every one who has attempted thus to extend his conceptions, and I may even say a greater than any other theoretical branch of knowledge, for which he would not willingly exchange it, because here all other cognitions, and even purposes, must meet and unite themselves in a whole.',
    'I offer, therefore, these Prolegomena as a sketch and text-book for this investigation, and not the work itself. Although I am even now perfectly satisfied with the latter as far as contents, order, and mode of presentation, and the care that I have expended in weighing and testing every sentence before writing it down, are concerned (for it has taken me years to satisfy myself fully, not only as regards the whole, but in some cases even as to the sources of one particular proposition); yet I am not quite satisfied with my exposition in some sections of the doctrine of elements, as for instance in the deduction of the conceptions of the Understanding, or in that on the paralogisms of pure reason, because a certain diffuseness takes away from their clearness, and in place of them, what is here said in the Prolegomena respecting these sections, may be made the basis of the test.',
    'It is the boast of the Germans that where steady and continuous industry are requisite, they can carry things farther than other nations. If this opinion be well founded, an opportunity, a business, presents itself, the successful issue of which we can scarcely doubt, and in which all thinking men can equally take part, though they have hitherto been unsuccessful in accomplishing it and in thus confirming the above good opinion. But this is chiefly because the science in question is of so peculiar a kind, that it can be at once brought to completion and to that enduring state that it will never be able to be brought in the least degree farther or increased by later discoveries, or even changed (leaving here out of account adornment by greater clearness in some places, or additional uses), and this is an advantage no other science has or can have, because there is none so fully isolated and independent of others, and which is concerned with the faculty of cognition pure and simple. And the present moment seems, moreover, not to be unfavorable to my expectation, for just now, in Germany, no one seems to know wherewith to occupy himself, apart from the so-called useful sciences, so as to pursue not mere play, but a business possessing an enduring purpose.',
    'To discover the means how the endeavors of the learned may be united in such a purpose, I must leave to others. In the meantime, it is my intention to persuade any one merely to follow my propositions, or even to flatter me with the hope that he will do so; but attacks, repetitions, limitations, or confirmation, completion, and extension, as the case may be, should be appended. If the matter be but investigated from its foundation, it cannot fail that a system, albeit not my own, shall be erected, that shall be a possession for future generations for which they may have reason to be grateful.',
    'It would lead us too far here to show what kind of metaphysics may be expected, when only the principles of criticism have been perfected, and how, because the old false feathers have been pulled out, she need by no means appear poor and reduced to an insignificant figure, but may be in other respects richly and respectably adorned. But other and great uses which would result from such a reform, strike one immediately. The ordinary metaphysics had its uses, in that it sought out the elementary conceptions of the pure understanding in order to make them clear through analysis, and definite by explanation. In this way it was a training for reason, in whatever direction it might be turned; but this was all the good it did; service was subsequently effaced when it favored conceit by venturesome assertions, sophistry by subtle distinctions and adornment, and shallowness by the ease with which it decided the most difficult problems by means of a little school-wisdom, which is only the more seductive the more it has the choice, on the one hand, of taking something from the language of science, and on the other from that of popular discourse, thus being everything to everybody, but in reality nothing at all. By criticism, however, a standard is given to our judgment, whereby knowledge may be with certainty distinguished from pseudo-science, and firmly founded, being brought into full operation in metaphysics; a mode of thought extending by degrees its beneficial influence over every other use of reason, at once infusing into it the true philosophical spirit. But the service also that metaphysics performs for theology, by making it independent of the judgment of dogmatic speculation, thereby assuring it completely against the attacks of all such opponents, is certainly not to be valued lightly. For ordinary metaphysics, although it promised the latter much advantage, could not keep this promise, and moreover, by summoning speculative dogmatics to its assistance, did nothing but arm enemies against itself. Mysticism, which can prosper in a rationalistic age only when it hides itself behind a system of school-metaphysics, under the protection of which it may venture to rave with a semblance of rationality, is driven from this, its last hiding-place, by critical philosophy. Last, but not least, it cannot be otherwise than important to a teacher of metaphysics, to be able to say with universal assent, that what he expounds is Science, and that thereby genuine services will be rendered to the commonweal.',

    'Introduction.',
    "These introductory notes are meant for future teachers rather than students. Even teachers shouldn't expect them to provide a ready-made understanding of a complete science; instead, they are intended to help in discovering the science itself.",
    "There are educated people who see the history of philosophy, both old and new, as the essence of philosophy itself; this passage isn't for them. They should wait until those trying to understand philosophy by thinking deeply have finished their work. Then, historians can tell everyone what has been done. Unfortunately, these scholars believe that nothing new can be said that hasn't been said before, and this view will probably always hold true. Since human reason has explored countless topics in many different ways for centuries, it's unlikely that we won't find similarities between new ideas and old sayings from the past.",
    'My goal is to convince everyone who believes studying metaphysics is important to take a moment to pause. Before considering any past work, we should first ask ourselves, "Is metaphysics even possible?"',
    "If this is truly a science, why can't it achieve universal and lasting recognition like other sciences do? And if it's not a science, how does it keep people hopeful without ever meeting their expectations? No matter if we show our understanding or ignorance of this subject, we need to finally decide what kind of \"science\" this really is, because it can't continue as it is now. It's almost silly that, while other sciences are moving forward, this one—which claims to be wisdom itself and has everyone seeking its insights—keeps us stuck in the same place with no progress. As a result, its supporters have dwindled, and we don't see experts from other fields risking their reputations here. This is because, in this area, anyone can give their opinion since there's no reliable way to separate true knowledge from empty talk.",
    "It's not unusual, when a field of study has developed significantly, for people to start questioning how far it has come and whether it's even achievable. Humans love creating complex ideas so much that sometimes they'll construct a whole system of thought just to tear it down and inspect its basic principles. It's never too late to gain wisdom, but the later you start, the harder it is to make changes.",
    "The question of whether a science is possible assumes doubt about its reality. But such doubt bothers those whose entire value is tied to this supposed treasure, so anyone who questions it can expect to face opposition from all sides. Some people, proud of their old and therefore respected knowledge, will wave around their books and look down on him with disdain. Others, who only recognize what they're already familiar with, won’t understand him, and everything will stay unchanged for a while, as if nothing has happened to spark concern or hope for an upcoming change.",
    "However, I dare say that anyone who reads these introductory notes will not only question what they previously knew about science, but will eventually be convinced that it can't exist unless the conditions I've outlined here are met. Since this hasn't been done so far, there is currently no true Metaphysics. Yet, because it's always needed—since it's closely linked to common sense—we must admit that a complete overhaul or a fresh start with a new approach to the science is necessary, even if people resist it for a time.",
    "Since Locke and Leibnitz's essays, or really since metaphysics began as far as we know, nothing has influenced its course more than David Hume's critique. He didn't clarify this type of knowledge, but he definitely sparked an idea that could have led to greater understanding if it had found a supportive environment and been carefully nurtured.",
    "Hume focused on an important idea in Metaphysics called Cause and Effect, along with related concepts like force and action. He questioned reason, which claims to have created this idea on its own, to justify why it believes that if one thing happens, something else must necessarily happen too, which is what the concept of cause means. He clearly showed that it's impossible for reason to understand and explain why things must be connected in a certain way just by thinking about it. We can't understand why one thing's existence means another must exist, or how this idea could come from pure thought. So, he concluded that reason is mistaken about this concept, thinking it developed it, when really it's created by the imagination based on experience, mixing up habitual patterns with real necessity. He argued that reason can't genuinely think of such connections, because if it did, they'd be made-up, and all supposed knowledge would just be ordinary experiences mistakenly seen as special. Simply put, he suggested that metaphysics doesn't really exist.",
    "Although Hume's conclusion might seem rushed and wrong, it was based on research. This research deserved the focused attention of the brightest thinkers of his time, along with their determined efforts to possibly find a better solution as he suggested. If they had done this, it would have quickly led to a complete reform of the science.",
    "But Hume had the typical problem metaphysicians face: people didn't understand him. It's really frustrating to watch how much his critics like Reid, Oswald, Beattie, and Priestley misunderstood him. They assumed the very things Hume was questioning and excitedly proved things he never doubted in the first place. As a result, they misinterpreted his important ideas, and nothing changed at all.",
    "The issue wasn't about whether the idea of cause was correct, useful, or absolutely necessary for understanding nature—Hume never doubted it was. The real question was whether this idea could be understood by reason alone, without needing any experience, and if so, whether it had a deeper truth beyond just our experiences. That was the problem Hume was exploring. It wasn't about whether the concept was necessary, but about where it came from. If he figured out the origin, then it would naturally clarify how and when the concept should be used.",
    "To really tackle the problem, opponents of the great thinker needed to deeply understand pure reasoning—a job they weren't suited for. Instead, they found it easier to defy without understanding by claiming \"common sense.\" While common sense is indeed valuable, it should be demonstrated through thoughtful and logical ideas, not just cited as a go-to answer when there's no rational justification. Relying on common sense as soon as knowledge and science don't provide answers is a modern tactic that lets even shallow debaters challenge deep thinkers. But as long as there's any real understanding, no one would resort to this trick. Essentially, it's just appealing to the crowd's opinion—something that superficial people might pride themselves on but true philosophers find embarrasing. I believe Hume had as much right to claim common sense as Beattie did and, on top of that, possessed critical reasoning that Beattie lacked. This helps keep common sense in check and stops it from jumping to conclusions in areas where it can't back up its own claims. Only like this can common sense stay reliable. Simple tools might work for carving wood, but for engraving metal, you need special needles. So, common sense and deep understanding are useful in different situations—the former for day-to-day decisions, and the latter for thinking about bigger ideas, like in metaphysics, where so-called \"common sense\" isn't really appropriate.",
    "I openly admit that it was David Hume's suggestion that first shook me out of my comfortable ignorance many years ago and led me to explore speculative philosophy in a new way. I didn't completely agree with his conclusions because he only looked at part of the problem, which wasn't enough to give a complete understanding. But if we build on a solid, though incomplete, idea left by someone else, we can hope to make more progress through our own ongoing thinking than even the brilliant person who first inspired us.",
    "So, I first tried to see if Hume's problem could be turned into a general idea. I quickly realized that the idea of cause and effect isn’t the only way our mind understands the connection between things without experience; in fact, metaphysics is all about these kinds of connections. I wanted to find out how many of these connections there are, and I started from a single principle. I found out that these concepts aren't based on experience, as Hume thought, but come from pure understanding. Figuring this out was a big challenge because it hadn’t been done before, as it was unclear how these concepts had any objective truth. Metaphysics back then couldn’t help much because this idea was needed to make metaphysics possible. Once I solved Hume’s problem in a broader sense, not just in specific cases, I was able to slowly but surely map out all of pure reason completely and systematically. This was necessary to build metaphysics in a reliable way.",
    "I worry that my work on Hume's problem, which I address in my \"Critique of Pure Reason,\" will face the same issues as the problem itself did when it was first introduced. It will be judged unfairly because people misunderstand it, and they misunderstand it because they choose to skim through the book instead of really thinking about it. This is not easy to do because the book is dry, complex, goes against common ideas, and is also quite lengthy. I admit, though, I didn't expect philosophers to complain about the book not being popular, entertaining, or easy, especially when we're dealing with something highly valuable and necessary that needs strict precision to be proven. Popularity can come later, but it shouldn't be expected from the start. That said, people are right to complain about some confusion due to the lengthy layout, which makes important points easy to miss. I aim to fix this with my current introductory notes.",
    'The initial work, which explores the full range and limits of pure reason, will serve as the foundation to which the Prolegomena, as an introductory exploration, is related. Our critique needs to be fully developed and recognized as a science before we can consider introducing Metaphysics or have any hope of achieving it.',
    "We've gotten used to seeing old knowledge presented as new just by changing its context and giving it a modern twist with fancy titles. Most people will probably expect more of the same from the Critique. However, these Prolegomena might convince them that this is a truly new science that no one has ever even thought about before. Previously, nothing comes close to this, except maybe Hume's doubts. Even then, Hume didn't think of it as a structured science. Instead, he chose to stop at skepticism, letting it sit there without progress. But I aim to provide guidance, using reliable methods based on knowledge of the world, complete with charts and a compass, to navigate safely in any desired direction.",
    "In a new and unique field of study, if we assume we can understand things using what we already know—something we should question—we might think we recognize everything based on familiar terms. However, everything will seem completely changed, confusing, and hard to understand because we're relying on our own ingrained ideas instead of the author's intended meaning. The lengthy nature of the work, due to the topic rather than how it is explained, its resulting dryness, and precise academic style may make the book less appealing but ultimately help the field of science.",
    'Few writers have the subtlety and grace of David Hume, or the depth and elegance of Moses Mendelssohn. Still, I believe I could have made my ideas more popular if my goal was just to outline a plan for others to finish, rather than focusing on the well-being of the science I had dedicated myself to for so long. In fact, it took a lot of patience and self-control to give up immediate success for the chance of achieving a more enduring reputation.',
    "Making plans is often something done by someone who is wealthy and likes to show off. They want to be seen as creative geniuses by asking for things they can't provide themselves, criticizing things they can't make better, and suggesting things they don't know how to find. But, if we're actually going to make a solid plan for reviewing pure reason, it has to be more than just guesses or hopeful wishes. Pure reason is so unique and self-contained that you can't change one part without it affecting everything else. So, we need to figure out where each part fits and how it connects to everything else; since we can't rely on outside judgments, the importance and usefulness of any part depends on its relationship to all the other parts within the realm of reason.",
    'In an organized body, the purpose of each part can only be understood by looking at the whole thing. So, you can only trust a critique if it covers everything completely, right down to the tiniest aspects of pure reason. When it comes to this kind of thinking, you either know everything or you know nothing.',
    "Even though an outline made before the Critique of Pure Reason wouldn't make sense or be useful, it's actually very helpful when it comes afterwards. This allows us to understand the entire concept, look closely at the key important points in the study, and make our presentation better than the first version of the work.",
    'After finishing the work, I’m providing a plan designed using an analytical method. The work itself was put together in a synthetic way so the science can show all its parts as a unique cognitive structure. If anyone finds this plan, which I call the Prolegomena to any future Metaphysics, still unclear, keep in mind not everyone needs to study Metaphysics. Many people do well in exact and deep sciences connected more to practical experience, even if they struggle with purely abstract concepts. In those cases, they should focus on other topics. However, if someone wants to judge or build a system of Metaphysics, they must meet the requirements I’ve set by either accepting my solution or thoroughly disproving it and offering another. Avoiding it is not an option.',
    "In conclusion, remember that this often criticized complexity (which people sometimes use as an excuse for their own laziness or lack of insight) actually has its benefits. In other fields, people who wisely choose to stay silent feel free to speak decisively in metaphysics because there's no obvious comparison to others' knowledge. However, their ignorance does stand out when compared to solid critical principles, which, to borrow the words of Virgil, we should praise.",

    'Section 1: The Origins of Metaphysics.',
    'If we want to turn any area of knowledge into a science, we first need to clearly identify its unique features that set it apart from other sciences. This way, we can avoid confusing the boundaries between different sciences and ensure each one is studied properly.',
    'The traits that define a science could be based on differences in what it studies, where it gets its knowledge, the type of knowledge it involves, or all three combined. This is what shapes the concept of a possible science and its area of study.',
    "First, when it comes to the sources of metaphysical knowledge, the idea itself means they cannot be based on observation or experience. Its foundational ideas and rules should not come from what we experience. Metaphysical knowledge isn't about the physical world but about what lies beyond it. This means it can't be based on outside experiences like physics, or internal experiences like psychology. Instead, it's knowledge gained from pure thought and reasoning, independent of experience.",
    'So far, Metaphysics would seem similar to pure Mathematics, but it should be called pure philosophical knowledge instead. For what this term means, you can see the explanation in the Critique of Pure Reason (Part II, "Method of Transcendentalism," Chapter 1, Section 1), which explains the difference between these two uses of reason. This covers the sources of metaphysical knowledge.',
    'About the Type of Understanding that Can Truly be Called Metaphysical.',
    'Distinction between Analytical and Synthetical Judgments in General: Metaphysical knowledge must be made up entirely of judgments based on reason alone, without using experience. Regardless of where they come from or their logical structure, judgments are different based on their content: they can either simply explain without adding anything new (analytical judgments) or add new information to what is already known (synthetical judgments).',
    "Analytical judgments just spell out what's already included in the concept of the subject, even if it wasn't completely clear before. When I say: All bodies take up space, I'm not adding anything new to what I think a body is; I'm just breaking it down, because the idea of taking up space was part of what I thought a body was, even if I hadn't said it outright. So, this is called an analytical judgment. But when I say: All bodies have weight, I'm adding something new that isn't already part of the basic idea of a body. This expands my understanding, so it's called a synthetic judgment.",
    "The main rule for all analytical judgments is the Law of Contradiction. All analytical judgments are based entirely on this law and involve knowledge that comes from reasoning alone, regardless of whether the information involved is from experience. In an affirmative analytical judgment, the attribute is already included in the idea of the subject, and denying it would contradict itself. Similarly, in a negative analytical judgment, the opposite attribute is automatically excluded from the subject by this same law. For example, it's like saying all physical objects take up space, and no physical objects don't take up space.",
    'All analytical judgments are known in advance, even when the concepts come from experience. For example, "Gold is a yellow metal." To understand this, I don\'t need any experience beyond the idea of gold being a yellow metal. It\'s part of the definition itself, and I just need to think about it without looking at anything else.',
    'Synthetical judgments need a different principle than the Law of Contradiction. There are synthetical judgments based on experience (a posteriori), but there are also those that are certain without experience (a priori), and come from pure understanding and reason. Both types share the trait that they cannot come solely from analysis or the law of contradiction; they need a different principle. Even though not everything is derived from the law of contradiction, it must still be followed. I will first categorize synthetical judgments.',
    "Empirical judgments are always about connecting ideas in new ways, rather than just analyzing what's already known. It wouldn't make sense to base a judgment that just breaks down concepts on experience because we don't need experience to understand it fully. For example, saying that a body takes up space is a judgment we can make without needing any real-world experience. We already have all the information needed within the concept itself, and by following logical rules, we can confirm the truth of the judgment without needing experience to prove it.",
    "2. Mathematical judgments are all synthetic. This fact seems to have been overlooked by those who have studied human reasoning; it even seems to contradict their predictions, though it is undoubtedly true and highly significant. People thought that since mathematicians' conclusions follow the law of contradiction (as required for absolute certainty), the basic principles must also be known through the same law. This was a big mistake because while a synthetic proposition can be understood according to the law of contradiction, it can only do so by assuming another synthetic proposition that it is based on, and never independently.",
    "Firstly, we need to note that all true mathematical statements are based on a priori knowledge, meaning they are not based on experience, because they involve a level of certainty that can't come from experience. However, if you don't agree with this, that's fine; I'll focus only on pure Mathematics, which by definition includes knowledge that is purely based on a priori principles and not on experience.",
    'At first, you might think that the equation 7 + 5 = 12 is obvious, just because that’s what you get when you add seven and five together. But if you look closer, the idea of adding 7 and 5 doesn’t automatically tell you that it equals 12. Simply thinking about adding these numbers doesn’t reveal the answer. To truly understand why 7 + 5 equals 12, you need to visualize it somehow, like using your fingers or drawing dots. This process adds new information to our understanding. So, when we say 7 + 5 = 12, we’re actually learning something new. This kind of mathematical statement is called synthetic, because it combines different ideas to create new understanding. The larger the numbers, the more obvious it becomes that we can’t figure them out just by breaking the concepts down without a visual aid.',
    "All principles of geometry can be analyzed. Saying a straight line is the shortest distance between two points is a combined idea. The idea of a straight line doesn't include anything about length, just its form. So, the idea that it's the shortest doesn't come from analyzing the concept itself. We need visualization to help us understand this because it enables us to put this idea together.",
    "Some geometric principles are actually based on analytical reasoning and rely on logical consistency, like saying a thing is equal to itself (a = a) or a whole is greater than a part (a + b > a). These are basic truths used to connect ideas but aren't considered foundational principles. We accept them in mathematics because they can be shown visually. Often, we think that the conclusion of these obvious statements is already included in the initial concept, making them analytical. However, it's not about what we assume should be connected to the concept but what we actually understand, even if not clearly. Thus, the conclusion belongs to these ideas not directly but through visualization.",
    'A Note on the Basic Types of Judgments: Analytical and Synthetical.',
    "This division is essential for understanding human thinking and should be respected, even if it's not very useful otherwise. Dogmatic philosophers, who look for the origins of metaphysical ideas within Metaphysics itself instead of in the basic laws of reason, often ignore this obvious distinction. Because of this, famous philosophers like Wolf and Baumgarten tried to prove the principle of Sufficient Reason, which is clearly synthetic, using the principle of Contradiction. In Locke's Essay, though, I notice a hint of my division. In the fourth book, he talks about the different connections between ideas in judgments and their sources. He identifies one source as \"identity and contradiction\" (analytical judgments), and another as the coexistence of ideas in a subject. He admits that our a priori knowledge of the latter is very limited, almost nonexistent. However, his comments on this kind of knowledge are vague and not well-defined, so it's understandable that no one, not even Hume, was inspired to research these types of judgments. Such clear and general principles aren't easily learned from others who only partly understand them. We have to first figure them out ourselves, and then we can recognize them in other works, even if the original authors weren't aware of them. People who don't think independently can still cleverly find everything that's been pointed out to them, even in old writings where it wasn’t noticed before.",
    'Section 4. The Main Question of the Introduction—Is Metaphysics Possible at All?',
    'If we had a real science of metaphysics that was established and reliable, we could say, "Here\'s metaphysics; learn it, and it will undeniably convince you of its truth forever." If that were the case, then the only remaining question would be more of a test of our insight, rather than proving the science itself: "How is this science possible, and how does our reasoning help us understand it?" Unfortunately, human reason hasn\'t been so lucky with metaphysics. There\'s no definitive book, like there is with Euclid for geometry, that you can point to and say, "This is Metaphysics; here you can discover the most important aspects of the field, like the existence of a supreme being and life after death, all demonstrated through pure logical reasoning." Sure, we can find plenty of unquestionable, logically certain ideas, but these only deal with the basic tools and framework for metaphysics rather than expanding our understanding, which is the ultimate goal of studying it (§ 2). Even if you introduce new logical ideas (like the principle of Sufficient Reason, which hasn\'t been satisfactorily proven just through logic, even though we accept it as true), they lead to such doubtful claims that throughout history, one metaphysical theory often contradicts another, either in what it claims or how it proves it. This inconsistency undermines its credibility. In fact, the efforts to establish a science of metaphysics have mostly led to early skepticism, a mindset where people essentially doubt everything because they lose hope of ever fulfilling their deepest desires. Before people tried to systematically study nature, they relied on abstract thinking, influenced by everyday experiences. Reason is always with us, while discovering natural laws usually requires hard work. So metaphysics rose to the surface like bubbles, disappearing as soon as they were collected. But as soon as one set of ideas vanished, new ones appeared, and while some people eagerly grabbed them, others laughed at their efforts instead of trying to understand what was causing these ideas to form.',
    "The main thing that makes pure mathematical thinking different from other types of knowledge that come from pure reasoning is that it doesn't come from just using concepts. Instead, it comes from building those concepts. In making judgments, math must go beyond concepts to include what you can visualize. Because of this, these judgments can't and shouldn't just come from breaking down a concept into parts; they are created by combining ideas.",
    "I can't help but point out how ignoring a simple observation has hurt philosophy. Hume, a philosopher, wanted to explore all areas of human knowledge. However, he mistakenly dismissed pure mathematics, thinking it relied only on the principle of contradiction, without acknowledging that mathematics also involves foundational truths that can't be broken down and analyzed. Hume's oversight led him to misunderstand the nature of knowledge, where he wrongly assumed mathematics was purely analytical, like breaking down complex ideas into simpler ones, while metaphysics dealt with new insights that synthesize information. If Hume had realized that mathematics also involved building new knowledge from fundamental ideas, he wouldn't have limited metaphysical judgments to personal experiences. Moreover, if he hadn't misunderstood this, he wouldn't have dismissed metaphysics so casually because it was linked with mathematics, a field he respected. Had he recognized this, his conclusions would have been insightful and communicated with his unique elegance.",
    'Metaphysical judgments are all about combining ideas in new ways. We need to separate judgments related to metaphysics from true metaphysical judgments. Many judgments in metaphysics just break down existing ideas, but true metaphysical judgments build new insights, which is the goal of the field. For example, if we consider concepts in metaphysics like "substance," we might analyze it to say something like "substance is something that only exists as a subject." These analytical judgments help us define concepts. However, analyzing a pure metaphysical concept is no different from analyzing any other idea, like saying "air is an elastic fluid," which doesn’t change no matter how cold it gets. So, the concept itself is metaphysical, but not the judgment about it. Metaphysics is unique because it produces knowledge independently, requiring us to distinguish what’s special about it compared to other types of rational knowledge. For instance, saying "all substance is permanent" is a new metaphysical insight.',
    'If the basic principles, which make up the subject of metaphysics, are gathered according to set rules, then analyzing them is very valuable. It could be taught as its own section, focusing only on analytical judgments in metaphysics, separate from the synthetic ones that really make up the field of metaphysics. These analyses are particularly useful in metaphysics, especially when it comes to creating new synthetic judgments based on these analyzed ideas.',
    'The conclusion here is that metaphysics mainly deals with synthetic propositions that are known independently of experience (a priori). These are its main focus. Even though metaphysics involves breaking down concepts into clearer parts through analysis, just like in any other field, the main concern is how we understand things through both examples and ideas. The key topic in metaphysics is creating new knowledge that is both synthesized and a priori.',
    "Tired of dogmatism, which teaches us nothing, and of skepticism, which doesn't promise us anything, not even the peace of being okay with what we don't know, we are troubled by how important knowledge is and are left doubting all the knowledge we think we have or that claims to be pure reason. There's one crucial question that remains for us to answer, which will guide our future actions: Is Metaphysics possible at all? However, we need to answer this question not by doubting any existing metaphysical system (since we aren't sure such a system even exists), but by considering the idea of a science like this as a possibility.",
    "In the Critique of Pure Reason, I explored this question by examining pure reason itself, trying to figure out its basic components and how it operates. This is a tough task and needs a dedicated reader to slowly understand a system that relies only on reason and doesn't depend on any factual evidence, aiming to develop knowledge from its very beginnings. Prolegomena, on the other hand, are meant as practice exercises. They aim to show us what we need to do to try and create a science, rather than actually creating it. They should be based on something we already trust and know well, which can lead us to new and unknown sources. These new findings will not only clarify what we already know but also reveal many new ideas that all originate from the same place. The method of Prolegomena, especially those intended to prepare for future metaphysics, is therefore analytical.",
    "Luckily, even though we can't claim metaphysics is a real science, we can confidently say that certain pure a priori knowledge, like pure Mathematics and pure Physics, is real and exists. These fields have propositions that are accepted as completely certain, either through pure reasoning or general agreement based on experience, yet they aren't dependent on experience. Therefore, we have some undisputed knowledge that comes before experience, so we don't need to ask if it's possible—it clearly is. Instead, we need to figure out how it's possible so we can understand the principle that makes this knowledge possible and apply it to other areas.",
    'The Main Question: How Can We Understand Cognition Through Pure Reason?',
    "In the previous section, we explored the important difference between analytical and synthetical judgments. Understanding analytical propositions was straightforward because they are based on the principle of contradiction. Synthetical a posteriori judgments, which are derived from experience, also don't need much explanation because experience is simply a continuous combination of perceptions. This leaves us with synthetical propositions a priori. These need further investigation to understand how they're possible since they depend on principles beyond just the law of contradiction.",
    "We don't need to prove that these types of statements are possible before questioning their possibility. There are enough of them that are definitely certain, and since we're using an analytical approach, we'll begin with the understanding that these types of logical but rational insights do exist. Our task now is to explore how these insights are possible so that we can establish rules for their use, understand their scope, and define their limits. The main problem we need to address, stated in precise academic terms, is:",
    "How is it possible to have knowledge that's both new and independent of experience?",
    "To make it more relatable, I've explained this problem in a slightly different way, focusing on purely rational thinking. I can do this once without losing clarity because we're discussing metaphysics and its origins. I hope the reader understands that when we talk about purely rational thinking, we mean synthetic knowledge, not analytical.",
    "The fate of metaphysics depends completely on solving this problem. Its existence hinges on it. No matter how convincing someone's metaphysical claims might seem or how many conclusions they present, if they can't satisfactorily answer this question, I can rightfully say their philosophy is groundless and their wisdom is false. You insist on using pure reason to claim that you can create knowledge independently of experience—not only by breaking down concepts but also by making connections not based on contradictions. How do you come to these conclusions, and how will you defend them? You can't rely on what most people agree on because that's just hearsay. As Horace said:",

    "The answer to this question is important but tough to find. A big reason it hasn't been answered before is that people didn't think of asking it. Another reason is that finding a good answer takes a lot of deep thinking, more than a long book on Metaphysics, which might have seemed groundbreaking at first. Anyone who thinks about this problem will see it's hard and might even think it's unsolvable, if not for the fact that pure a priori knowledge does exist. This realization happened to David Hume, although he didn't quite grasp the question as broadly as needed for Metaphysics. He wondered how it's possible to connect two concepts logically when one isn't obviously linked to the other just by thinking about it. Hume thought that only experience can provide such links, believing the perceived 'necessity' or a priori knowledge is just a habit of believing something to be true, confusing personal belief with actual truth.",
    "If you find solving this problem difficult or tedious, feel free to find an easier solution yourself. You might then appreciate the effort I've put into thoroughly researching it. You might even be surprised at how easily, given the complexity of the topic, I've managed to solve it. Keep in mind, it took years to solve it comprehensively for all cases, and to present it in the straightforward way you see here.",
    'All philosophers dealing with the theory of knowledge are officially paused from their work until they can satisfactorily answer the question, "How can we know things before experiencing them?"

If they don\'t have this proof, they can\'t expect anything other than being ignored by people who have been misled before.',
    "If they want to continue their work as an art of good speaking that makes sense to everyday people, they should be allowed to do so. They should speak with reasonable belief and admit that they can't guess or know anything beyond what can be experienced. They can assume the existence of something useful for practical purposes, which helps guide understanding and decisions in life. Only then can they be considered helpful and wise, especially if they give up calling themselves metaphysicians. Metaphysicians claim to be speculative thinkers and when it comes to firm knowledge, vague guesses aren't acceptable. What they claim as known must either be scientific or of no value at all.",
    "You could say that the whole transcendental philosophy, which needs to come before all metaphysics, is basically the complete answer to the problem being posed here, organized and complete. Until now, we've never really had a true transcendental philosophy because what we call that now is actually just a part of metaphysics. Transcendental philosophy is supposed to make metaphysics possible, so it needs to come first. It's not surprising that when a whole new science, with no help from other sciences, is expected to answer one big question clearly, it ends up being difficult and confusing.",
    'We now move on to this solution using an analytical method. This means we start by assuming that there are indeed some pure reason-based understandings. We focus on two specific sciences that deal with theoretical understanding: pure mathematics and pure natural science (or physics). These sciences are the only ones that can present objects to us in a clear and tangible way. This means that if there is any knowledge gained without experience (a priori) within them, it can demonstrate the truth or match with the object in a real-world setting, showing that it is actual. From this point, we can work backward to understand how it is possible, using the analytical method. This makes our task much easier because we apply broad observations to actual situations and even begin with them, while in a synthetic method, we would have to develop them solely from theoretical concepts.',
    'To build a science of metaphysics from well-established pure knowledge that we know independently of experience, we need to understand what leads us to this knowledge. This means examining the natural, although sometimes questioned, understanding we have of these concepts, which form the basis of metaphysics.

    "Doesn't this ability to produce mathematics, which isn't based on experience, suggest that there might be some deep, hidden knowledge we know without experience? This hidden knowledge could become clear if we carefully explore how math starts.",
    "Mathematical thinking has a unique characteristic: it must first represent its ideas in a visual or intuitive way that isn't based on experience but is instead a pure form of visualization. Without this, math can't progress. Thus, mathematical judgments are always intuitive, unlike philosophy, which relies on reasoning from concepts and can only use illustrations rather than derive ideas from them. This insight into math shows us that its fundamental basis is a kind of visualization that's not tied to the senses, called pure intuition. If we understand this pure intuition and why it's possible, we can comprehend how it's possible to make new, certain insights in math before any experience, thus explaining how math itself can exist. Empirical intuition, or what we experience through our senses, allows us to expand our understanding of objects through experience. Pure intuition does something similar, but the difference is that mathematical intuition is certain before experience, while empirical certainty comes from experience. Since pure intuition is independent of particular experiences, it must be necessarily true.",
    'But this new step seems to make things even more confusing instead of clearer. Now we have to ask, "How can we visualize something without having experienced it beforehand?" Usually, when we visualize something, it is because the object is right in front of us. So it seems impossible to visualize something beforehand, because then we wouldn\'t have an object to look at, and it wouldn\'t really be visualization. We can easily think about certain ideas in general terms without directly seeing the object, like the ideas of Quantity or Cause, for example. But to understand these concepts, we usually need to see them applied to something concrete, like through a real-life example. So how can we visualize an object before the object itself even exists?',
    "If our way of understanding things through our senses was such that we could see things exactly as they are, then we wouldn't have knowledge of things independently of experience; our knowledge would always be based on actual experiences. I can only truly know what is in an object when it is right in front of me. Even then, it's hard to understand how just seeing or sensing something can help me know its true essence because the object's properties can't enter my mind. But, even if it were possible, this kind of understanding wouldn't happen without prior experience because there would be no way to connect my perception to the object without experiencing it or receiving some direct insight.",
    'In only one way can my intuition anticipate the reality of an object and be knowledge gained independently of experience: if my intuition includes only the basic shape of how I perceive things, which comes before any actual sensory experiences I have from interacting with objects.',
    "I can know in advance that we can only perceive sensory objects in this specific way. This means that statements related only to how we perceive through our senses are valid for sensory objects only. Similarly, intuitive insights that we know before experiencing can't apply to anything other than what we can sense.",
    "We can understand things before experiencing them using our senses, but we can only know objects as they appear to us, not as they truly are. This idea is essential if we accept that it's possible to make true statements without prior experience, and if we want to explain how these statements can exist.",
    "Pure mathematics relies on the basic ideas of space and time to form its concepts and judgments, which seem absolutely certain and necessary. Mathematics needs to build its ideas through a clear understanding of these concepts. If it didn't work this way, progress would be impossible because mathematics doesn't just break down ideas into parts but instead builds them up. Without space and time as foundational ideas, there wouldn't be a basis for forming new, universally accepted concepts. Geometry is grounded in the understanding of space, while arithmetic develops the idea of numbers by adding units over time. Even the idea of motion in mechanics needs time to make sense. Space and time are just intuitions, meaning that if you strip away all sensory details from our experiences of objects and their changes (like motion), space and time still exist. This proves they are inherent concepts we hold before any experience. They are just frameworks of our perception and help us understand objects as they appear to us.",
    "The problem we're dealing with is now solved. Pure mathematics, which involves understanding things through logical thinking without needing experience, is possible only by focusing on what we can sense. At the core of how we empirically perceive things is a basic intuition of space and time, which we know in advance. This is because space and time are just forms of our perception that exist before we actually encounter objects; they make encountering them possible. However, this understanding doesn't affect what the objects are made of (the sensory part), but only their form—space and time. If anyone doubts that space and time are not properties of objects themselves but are related to how we perceive them, I’d like to know how they explain understanding things before we actually experience them. Yet, that's exactly how it is with space and time. It's easy to understand as long as we see them as conditions of how we perceive things, meaning objects are simply experiences. This way, how we imagine things (pure intuition) can come from us beforehand, or a priori.",
    "To clarify this idea with an example, let's look at how geometrists usually work. When proving that two shapes are exactly the same (meaning one can fully replace the other), it often comes down to showing that they can be placed on top of each other perfectly. This proof is based on something we know intuitively, which we understand directly without needing further evidence. This intuitive understanding must be something we know instinctively (a priori), not something we've learned from experience, for the proof to be absolutely certain. Otherwise, we'd just be saying that this is what our experiences have shown us so far, and the idea would only hold as far as we can see. The fact that space is three-dimensional and cannot have more dimensions is based on the idea that only three lines can meet at right angles at one point, which we understand through intuition, not through logical reasoning alone. This idea is instinctively understood (a priori) as absolutely certain. Imagining a line going on forever or a series of changes happening without end requires a concept of space and time only understood through intuition, not reasoning. Therefore, the basis of math comes from these pure intuitive understandings, allowing us to make precise and absolutely certain statements. This is why understanding how we perceive space and time also helps explain how pure mathematics is possible. Without understanding this, we might accept the truth of mathematics, but we wouldn't understand why it exists, and we'd have to assume that everything sensed is perceived as it seems to us, not necessarily as it is objectively.",
    "For those who still think that space and time are real qualities that things inherently have, here's a paradox to consider. After trying unsuccessfully to solve it, and freeing themselves from their biases, they might start to believe that space and time are just ways we perceive things, which could actually make sense.",
    "If two things are completely the same in every way we can measure, both in terms of quantity and quality, then one can always replace the other without causing any noticeable change. This is true for flat shapes in geometry. However, some round shapes show such differences in how they relate to their surroundings that one cannot take the place of the other, even if they are exactly the same inside. For example, consider two spherical triangles on opposite sides of the equator that share part of the equator as their base. These triangles can be identical in terms of sides and angles, meaning nothing about one isn't true for the other. Yet, you can't swap one for the other due to their positions on opposite hemispheres. So, the difference between the two triangles is internal, but our minds can only understand this difference when we consider their positions in space.",
    "But I'll give examples from everyday life that are even more straightforward.",
    "What could be more similar in every way to my hand and ear than their reflections in a mirror? But I can't replace my real hand with the mirror image because if my real hand is the right hand, the reflection shows a left hand. The same goes for ears. You can't switch them because, even though they look the same, the reflected image can't replace the actual part. There's no internal difference we can figure out just by thinking about it, but as our senses show, the left hand can't fit into the same space as the right hand—a glove for one hand won't fit the other. Why is that? It’s because these reflections aren't actual objects as they exist in reality or as pure understanding would see them; they're appearances created by how unknown things relate to our senses. Space is how we perceive these appearances, and understanding any space inside this perception depends on how it relates to the overall space, a part of which it forms. This means parts exist through their relationship to the whole, unlike real objects which are simply themselves. That’s why seemingly identical things, like two symmetrical spirals, can’t always be overlaid or matched up perfectly just by thinking about them; their difference is understood through a sense of right and left, which we perceive directly.",
    'Note 1.',
    "Pure mathematics, especially pure geometry, only have real meaning when they relate to things we can sense. However, the principle here is that what we sense is not how things truly are, but how they seem to us. This means that geometric statements are not simply the product of our imagination, and we can't confidently say they relate to actual objects. Instead, they are always valid for space and anything in space, because space is just the shape of how we perceive things externally. This perception is the foundation of geometry and necessary for things to appear to us externally, meaning these appearances will always follow geometric rules.",
    "If our senses showed us objects exactly as they are, it would be different. Then, just because we think about space in a certain way, using it as a foundation for geometry and all its conclusions, wouldn’t mean it matches reality. The space used in geometry would be seen as imaginary and wouldn't be considered real, because we don't understand how things must naturally fit an idea of them that we create before we know them. But if this idea - this structured way of viewing things - is a key part of how we perceive, showing us not the things themselves but how they appear, then it's clear and definitely true that all outside objects we experience must perfectly match with geometry. This is because our perception, through how we visualize space, is the same as in geometry, making those objects possible as appearances.",
    "It's an interesting point in the history of philosophy that there was a period when even mathematicians, who were also philosophers, started to question not the accuracy of their geometric theories about space, but whether these ideas really applied to the real world. They worried about whether lines in nature might actually be made of individual points, meaning real space could be made of separate parts, unlike the continuous space they imagined. They didn’t realize that this imagined space allows us to understand real space and matter. This pure space isn't something that exists on its own, but a way our minds perceive things. All objects in space are just appearances, not things as they truly are, but our mind’s representations. The space that geometers talk about is a basic way our minds perceive things before experience, and it’s how we can understand all external appearances. These appearances must align completely with geometric principles, not because they’re imaginary, but because they’re based on our perception. This is how geometry proves its real-world application against any philosophical doubts that arise from misunderstanding the origins of its concepts.",
    'Note II.',
    "Whatever we perceive as an object must be experienced through our senses. Our understanding doesn't directly perceive anything but reflects on what is sensed. As we have shown, our senses do not allow us to know the true nature of things, only their appearances, which are just interpretations. Therefore, we conclude that everything we perceive, including space, is simply a representation in our minds and exists only in our thoughts. You might say: Isn't this clearly idealism?",
    'Idealism is the belief that nothing exists except thinking beings. Everything else we perceive is just an idea or image within these thinking beings, with no real-world counterpart. In contrast, I argue that things exist outside of us as objects of our senses. We don’t fully understand what they are on their own; we just know how they appear to us, based on how they affect our senses. I agree that there are real objects outside of us, which affect our senses and create the images we call "bodies." These are just our perceptions of something we don\'t truly understand, but they are still real. Can this viewpoint be called idealism? It\'s actually the opposite.',
    "Long before John Locke's time, and definitely since then, people have typically agreed that certain qualities of things don't actually belong to the things themselves but rather to how we perceive them. For example, qualities like heat, color, and taste don't exist outside of our perception. If I extend this idea to include other qualities we consider fundamental to objects—such as size, location, and space—saying these too are just appearances, there's no strong reason to oppose this idea. Just as someone who agrees that colors are not inherent to objects but are due to how we see them isn't considered an idealist, my perspective shouldn't be labeled as idealistic just because it includes more of these qualities.",
    'All the features that make up our perception of a body are just part of how it appears to us.',
    "The thing that exists isn't taken away, like in true idealism. Instead, it's shown that we can't truly understand it through our senses as it actually is.",
    "I'd like to know what I need to say to completely avoid idealism. Clearly, I'd have to claim that our perception of space matches the way our senses relate to objects—which I've already mentioned—and that it's just like the object itself. However, to me, this statement is as meaningless as saying the sensation of seeing red resembles the property of vermilion, which causes me to experience that sensation.",

    'So, we can quickly dismiss a predictable but weak objection: "that accepting space and time as ideas makes the entire physical world seem fake." Initially, understanding how we perceive things was misunderstood, with people thinking that our senses just muddled what is real, letting us know things vaguely but not clearly. However, we show that our senses define how we come to know things at all. Sensory perception doesn\'t show things as they truly are but rather how they interact with our senses. This means that through perception, we only grasp appearances, not the actual things, for our understanding. After clarifying this, some might wrongly claim, almost intentionally, that my view makes everything we sense an illusion.',
    "When we see something, we can still decide how to interpret it. What we see depends on our senses, but how we judge it depends on our understanding. The main question is whether our judgment is true or not. The difference between truth and dreaming isn't found in the type of things we see or imagine since they're the same in both cases. It's about whether or not they fit together according to the rules that make them make sense as a real object. If we mistake an illusion for truth, it's not because our senses are wrong; it's because we mistakenly think what we see is actually how things are. Our senses may show the paths of planets as moving forward or backward, and this is not false or true because as long as we see this as just an appearance, we're not judging how they actually move. But a wrong judgment can happen if our understanding doesn't recognize that our view might not be objective. When we say they appear to move backward, the misunderstanding isn't the fault of our senses but the responsibility of our understanding to correctly judge what we see.",
    "So, even if we don't think about where our ideas come from, whenever we link our senses together in space and time according to logical rules, we end up with either truth or error, depending on our carefulness. It's more about how we use these sensory ideas with our understanding than where they come from. Similarly, if I see all sensory ideas, including space and time, as just appearances and assume space and time are forms of our perception that don’t exist outside of us, and if I use these ideas for possible experiences only, viewing them as appearances won’t cause errors. They can properly align with the rules of truth. Thus, the truths of geometry apply to both space and all sensory objects, and therefore all potential experiences, whether I see space as just a form of our perception or as an inherent part of things. If it's the first case, I understand how I can know these geometrical truths beforehand about all external objects. Otherwise, everything else about possible experiences stays the same as if I had not changed from the common view.",
    "If I try to apply my ideas about space and time to things outside of what I can actually experience—and I tend to do this when I think of space and time as qualities that things inherently possess—I might make a big mistake because of a misunderstanding. By doing this, I assume something personal and subjective, based only on how we perceive things, is universally true for everything, including things we can't directly experience. This would mean I'm incorrectly applying my own perspective to things as they truly are, instead of just within the limits of my experiences.",
    "My idea that space and time are merely concepts we hold, rather than independent parts of reality, doesn't make the physical world a mere illusion. Instead, it ensures that important ideas, like those in mathematics, can apply to real things and not just be seen as imaginary. Without understanding this, we wouldn't know if the concepts of space and time—which we don't get from experience but know instinctively—are just figments of our imagination with no real-world match. This idea is crucial because it affirms that these concepts are valid for everything we perceive.",
    "Secondly, while my principles might make the sensory experiences seem like illusions, they actually help prevent the false perception that has confused metaphysics until now, where appearances are mistaken for reality, much like chasing after bubbles. This misunderstanding led to a notable contradiction in reasoning, which I'll discuss later. However, this contradiction can be resolved by observing that as long as appearances are used in experience, they produce truth, but once they go beyond experience, they create illusions.",
    'I acknowledge that things as we sense them are real, but I limit our sensory understanding to the fact that they only show how they appear to us, not their actual nature. I want to make it clear that I didn\'t invent any illusions about nature. My strong objection to accusations of idealism should be obvious, but since some people misunderstand and rely on outdated names for ideas without understanding the essence of philosophical terms, I need to clarify. I\'ve called my theory transcendental idealism, but it shouldn\'t be mixed up with Descartes\' empirical idealism, which questioned whether the physical world could be proven, or Berkeley\'s mystical idealism. My idealism doesn\'t doubt the existence of things; it focuses on how we perceive them, particularly in relation to space and time. I illustrate that these concepts aren\'t things themselves but ways we represent things. I used the term "transcendental" to highlight that this is about how we process knowledge, not about the things themselves. I now prefer to call it "critical" idealism to avoid confusion. If transforming real things into mere perceptions is a flawed version of idealism, what do we call someone who turns mere perceptions into things? I’d call it "dreaming idealism," different from "visionary," both of which my critical idealism aims to challenge.',

    "Nature refers to the way things exist according to universal laws. If by nature, we mean the existence of things as they are by themselves, we couldn't understand it either through logic or by experience. We can't know things in themselves through logic because breaking down our ideas (logical judgments) can't reveal this. We're not trying to discover what's already in our concept of a thing, because that just tells us about our mental understanding. Instead, we want to know what actually exists beyond our ideas and how a thing is defined in reality outside our thoughts. Our understanding doesn't set rules for things themselves; things don't adapt to our understanding. Instead, our understanding has to adapt to them. Therefore, things must be presented to us first, and from them, we perceive their characteristics, which means we can't know them through logic alone.",
    "Understanding the true nature of things after experiencing them is also impossible. If we rely on experience to teach us the laws that govern the existence of things, these laws would need to apply to the things themselves, even when we aren't observing them. However, experience only shows us what exists and how it exists, not that it has to exist in a specific way. Therefore, experience cannot teach us the true nature of things.",
    'We actually have a pure science of nature that sets out laws that nature must follow, and these laws are determined without needing any experience. This science, often called the universal Science of Nature, comes before any study of Physics, which relies on real-world observations. In it, we use math to describe how things appear and also use general ideas to understand nature. However, some concepts, like motion or the idea of matter not being able to occupy the same space, still rely on real-world experiences, so it\'s not a completely pure science. Furthermore, it only deals with things we can see or touch, so it\'s not a fully universal science of nature because a true universal science would apply to everything, whether physical or psychological. Still, there are universal principles, like "substance stays the same" and "every action is caused by something," which are true in all cases without needing experience. So, there is indeed a pure science of nature, and the question we need to ask is, how is this possible?',
    "The word \"nature\" can mean different things. One way it refers to how things follow certain rules, but here it's about the actual objects we experience. \"Nature\" in this sense means all things we can observe and experience. We focus on these because things we can't experience would require ideas that can't be proven with real-world examples. So, we need clear ideas about what we can experience. Understanding things we can't observe belongs to a field beyond physical science and isn't what we're discussing here. We're only talking about understanding nature, which can be backed up by experience, even if this understanding comes from knowledge we have before any experience.",
    "The formal aspect of nature, in a narrower sense, refers to the way all things we experience follow certain laws. When we understand these laws before experiencing them, we say they have a necessary order. However, we've seen that we can't know these laws ahead of time when it comes to things considered on their own, outside of our experience. Here, we're not focused on things in their independent form (which we're not discussing), but rather on things as we might experience them, which is what we mean by nature. Now, the question is: When discussing the possibility of knowing nature's laws beforehand, should we ask: How can we know in advance that things we experience will always follow laws? Or should we ask: How is it possible to understand beforehand that all experiences, and the things within them, must follow laws?",
    'When you look at it closely, the answer to the problem is the same, whether you look at it one way or another, when it comes to understanding nature purely (which is the main question here). The subjective rules, which are the only way we can learn about things through experience, apply to these things as objects that we can possibly experience (not as things in themselves, which we are not discussing here). Both of the following statements mean the same thing:',

    'Everything that we learn through experience happens because something causes it.',
    "It's better to go with the first option. We can understand the basics of how we experience things before we actually encounter them, but we can't know the rules that things follow on their own without experiencing them. So, to learn about things in general before experiencing them, we have to look at the basic conditions and general rules that apply to all experiences, and decide how things can exist as objects of experience. If I picked the second option, trying to figure out the conditions needed for nature to be seen as something we can experience, I might mistakenly think I'm talking about nature itself, getting stuck in endless confusion, looking for rules about things I know nothing about.",
    "We will focus only on experience and the universal conditions that make it possible, which are given beforehand. From this, we will define nature as the sum of everything we can possibly experience. Let me clarify that I'm not talking about the rules for observing a nature that already exists, since those rely on experience. Nor am I discussing how we can learn about nature's laws through experience, because those wouldn't be laws we're aware of without experience, and they wouldn't help us understand nature in a purely scientific way. Instead, I'm asking how the basic conditions necessary for experience also serve as the foundations for all the universal laws of nature.",
    'First, we need to explain that while all judgments based on experience come from direct sensory perception, not all judgments based on sensory information are judgments of experience. To turn sensory information into a judgment of experience, we need to add certain concepts that come from pure understanding and are not based on experience. These concepts must first be applied to perceptions before they can be transformed into experience.',
    "Empirical judgments that are valid objectively are called judgments of experience. However, those that are only valid subjectively are just judgments of perception. Judgments of perception don't need any pure concepts from understanding; they only need the logical connection of perception within the mind. Meanwhile, judgments of experience always need, in addition to sensory representation, specific concepts created in the understanding, which give them their objective validity.",
    "Initially, all of our judgments are just personal opinions, only valid for us. Later, we link these judgments to external objects and want them to be true for everyone. When a judgment matches an object, all other judgments about that object should also match, giving our opinion universal validity. Similarly, if we believe a judgment should be universally true, it must not only be personal but also relate to the object itself. If this weren't the case, there would be no reason for others to share our judgments unless they are also connected to the same object. All judgments therefore should be in agreement.",
    "So, when something is considered to be universally true for everyone, it means it has objective validity. Even though we can't know the object itself, if we see a judgment as both universal and necessary, we take it as having objective validity. This means we understand the object through universally and necessarily connected perceptions, even if we don't know the object itself. For all things we sense, we don't get their objective validity from direct knowledge (which is impossible), but from universally valid empirical judgments. These judgments don't rely on sensory conditions but on a pure concept of understanding. Though we can't know the object itself, when our understanding helps link the object's given perceptions universally, the object is defined by this connection, making the judgment objective.",
    "Here's an example to explain: When we say, \"the room is warm, sugar is sweet, and wormwood is bitter,\" we're making statements based on personal feelings. I don't expect that I or anyone else will always feel the same way; these statements just show how two sensations feel to me right now. So, they're not statements about the objects themselves. These are called perceptions. Judgments based on experience are different. When experience shows me something in certain situations, it should show the same thing to everyone, meaning the statement is not just about my personal feelings or a specific time. This makes these statements universally true. For example, when I say the air is elastic, that's just my perception. But for it to be a judgment based on experience, the conditions must make it true for everyone always. I'm suggesting that everyone should always see these perceptions the same way in the same situations.",
    "We need to break down experience to understand what comes from our senses and mind, and how we can form judgments based on experience. It starts with our awareness of what's around us, called perception, which is just about what we sense. Then, we have judgments, which are mental actions. Judging can happen in two ways: first, by simply comparing and linking what we perceive in our mind; or second, by connecting these perceptions more broadly in our awareness. The first type is a personal judgment and only relates to our individual perspective without considering the outside world. Therefore, just comparing and linking our perceptions in our mind is not enough for something to qualify as true experience. True experience involves universal and necessary judgments which are objectively valid.",
    'To turn perception into experience, we need to judge things differently. We have to fit what we see or sense into a concept that helps us decide how to think about it. This concept ties our specific awareness with our general awareness and makes our understanding of it universally applicable. One such concept is an a priori concept of Understanding, which means it helps us figure out how to use what we sense in general reasoning. For example, if we use the concept of "cause," it helps us interpret what we sense—like air—in the context of how things generally relate, such as cause and effect. This concept of cause is a pure notion from the mind, separate from everything we can perceive, and it only helps us decide how to universally judge or make sense of what we see.',
    'For a perception to turn into a judgment based on experience, it must be linked to a general concept understood by everyone. For example, when we think of air, we classify it under the concept of causes. This helps us make judgments about it, like saying its expansion is hypothetical. This means the expansion of air isn\'t just something I notice now or others might notice; it\'s understood to happen universally and necessarily. So, when we say "the air is elastic," it becomes a statement everyone can agree with through experience. This happens because other judgments have already linked our understanding of air to the idea of cause and effect. This process helps make our observations universally accepted, not just personally or among individual observers.',
    'If we break down all our synthetic judgments to see how they are valid in real-world terms, we\'ll find that they are not just made up of basic observations put together to form a judgment. Instead, they include a pure concept of understanding added to the ideas we get from observation. This combination makes the judgment valid. This is even true for basic mathematical judgments. For example, the statement "a straight line is the shortest distance between two points" relies on the concept of quantity, which is not just about observation but is understood through our mind. This helps us make judgments about the line concerning its quantity, recognizing that within any observation, there are multiple parts that can be counted or measured.',
    'To show how experience is possible based on pure concepts that we understand without needing to experience them first, we should start by explaining what makes up judgments in general and the different ways our understanding works, listing them out completely. These pure concepts align with these functions because they are essentially ideas about perceptions in general, determined by these ways of judging. This approach will clearly define the foundational principles needed for any experience to be objectively valid as knowledge based on experience. In essence, these principles are statements that apply general conditions of perception to these pure concepts of understanding.',

    "Experience is made up of two things: intuitions, which come from our senses, and judgments, which are created by our understanding. But when our understanding forms judgments just based on what our senses tell us, these aren't really judgments of experience. In one situation, a judgment only connects what we perceive through our senses, but in the other, it has to reflect what experience in general tells us, not just the perception itself (which is only personally valid). Therefore, a judgment of experience must add something to what we sense and logically connect, turning it into a general rule that is universally necessary and valid. This addition is a concept that explains how the intuition fits a specific kind of judgment, represented by a general logical function of judgments.",
    "Here's the main idea: our senses help us to perceive, and our understanding helps us to think. Thinking involves linking different ideas in our mind. This linking can either be specific to us and random, or universal and necessary. When we connect ideas in our mind, we make judgments. So, thinking is really just making judgments or connecting ideas overall. Judgments can be subjective, meaning they relate to one person’s mind, or objective, meaning they apply to anyone’s mind. All the different types of judgments are just ways of connecting ideas in our minds. If they help form concepts, these concepts involve necessary connections in our mind and are essential for valid judgments. This connection in our mind can be either analytical, through identifying sameness, or synthetic, by combining different ideas. Experience involves connecting perceptions in our mind in a way that is necessary. Thus, the basic concepts we use collectively to understand everything must exist before we can form judgments of experience, ensuring these connections of perceptions are necessary and universally relevant.",
    "Judgments, when we look at them simply as a way to combine given ideas in our minds, act like rules. These rules, if they show that the combination is necessary, are basic foundational rules that come before experience. If they can't be explained by more general rules, they are fundamental principles. But when it comes to understanding all experiences, just in terms of how we think about them, the most basic things we need for understanding experiences are the rules that organize our perceptions under pure concepts of understanding, making our judgments about experiences valid. These concepts are the essential building blocks of understanding possible experiences.",
    'The principles that allow us to understand possible experiences are also universal laws of nature that can be known beforehand, without needing experience. This answers the question, "How is pure natural science possible?" The structure needed for it to be considered a science is perfectly in place here because the basic rules found in logic are the only ones needed, forming a logical system. The basic ideas based on these rules, which contain the essential conditions for all necessary and combined judgments, make up a transcendental system. Finally, the principles that categorize all phenomena within these ideas make up a physical system or a nature system, which exists before we can have any practical understanding of nature, makes such understanding possible, and can therefore be accurately called the universal and pure science of nature.',
    'The first main principle in physiology applies everything we experience, as understood in terms of space and time, to the idea of Quantity, allowing Mathematics to be applied to these experiences. The second principle deals with what we actually sense, meaning the part of our experiences that feels real, not directly under Quantity because sensory experiences themselves don’t have space or time, even though they place objects within both. Despite this, there is a measurable difference between reality (as sensed) and total absence (or nothingness) in our experiences over time. For example, we can imagine varying levels of light versus darkness, heat versus cold, weight versus weightlessness, and filled space versus empty space. Similarly, we can think of levels of awareness versus complete unawareness, like a mind that’s totally blank. So, no perception shows a complete absence because even a lack of awareness can be seen as a form of awareness. This idea applies to all sensations, enabling us to anticipate experiences, giving us the principle: all sensations have a level or degree. This is the second way mathematics can be used to understand nature.',
    "When considering how things appear in terms of their existence, we don't use math but rather dynamic rules. These rules can't be truly valid for experiences unless they follow basic principles that make understanding these appearances possible. Therefore, appearances must fit under the idea of Substance, which is the core concept used to determine existence. Alternatively, if a sequence is observed among appearances, meaning something happens, it must fit under the idea of an Effect relating to a Cause. Lastly, if things coexist and we want to understand this objectively, we use the concept of Community, which involves interaction. These basic principles are the foundation of valid empirical judgments about the possibility of experience, connecting things as they exist in nature. These principles are the true laws of nature and are called dynamical.",
    'In the end, understanding how things relate and connect with each other in our experiences, and how they fit into our overall understanding of experience, is part of making judgments based on experience. This involves either recognizing their alignment with the logical rules our mind understands, or how they fit with what we perceive through our senses, or a combination of both. This understanding includes the ideas of Possibility, Actuality, and Necessity according to universal laws of nature, forming the basis for determining truth, distinguishing it from theories, and setting the limits on how certain we can be about these theories.',
    'Section 26: The third table of principles, based on exploring the nature of understanding itself in a critical way, reveals a natural excellence that surpasses all previous attempts at understanding by analyzing objects directly. It effectively presents all synthetic a priori principles according to a single foundational idea—the ability to make judgments. This ensures that we fully comprehend experience in relation to understanding and can confidently say there are no additional principles to uncover, something that is impossible with traditional methods. Furthermore, it is even more remarkable for another reason.',
    "We need to remember the evidence that shows how this kind of knowledge can exist independently of experience, while also keeping in mind the limits of these principles. These principles must be understood within specific conditions, to avoid being misunderstood or misused. These limits indicate that the principles only cover the conditions necessary for possible experience as they are subject to laws known independently of experience. Therefore, I am not claiming that things in themselves have measurable qualities, that their reality can be graded, or that their existence involves a connection of traits within a substance, etc. No one can prove these things because it's impossible to connect ideas this way without relating them to sensory experiences or how they fit into possible experiences. The main limitation of these concepts in the principles is that everything must inherently operate under the mentioned conditions solely as objects of experience.",
    'In simpler terms, these principles are proven in a unique way. Instead of directly linking them to things we see and their relationships, they relate to the possibility of experiencing those things. The things we see are like building blocks, not the whole structure. This approach helps us tell the difference between what we actually experience and what we just perceive. Since things we experience occupy space and time, they fit into the concept of Quantity, which organizes them according to certain rules beforehand. Additionally, perceptions exist along a scale, meaning aspects of them can gradually disappear, and we can identify these differing aspects as having different degrees. This concept of moving from nothingness in time and space shows that while sensibility (our ability to sense things) can’t be predicted exactly without a specific context, it can be quantified and differentiated from other kinds of sensibility based on intensity. This understanding allows us to apply mathematics to nature, based on our sense-based way of understanding nature.',
    'Above all, the reader needs to focus on how the principles in the section titled "Analogies of Experience" are proven. These principles don’t deal with how we form our basic perceptions, like those in applied mathematics, but rather how these perceptions are connected in our experience. This connection is about determining their existence in time according to specific laws, which makes the experience valid. The proof is not about how things connect with each other in reality but about how we perceive them in terms of timing and their relationships in time, based on universal laws. If this timing in our experiences is valid, then these universal laws dictate how things generally exist over time according to our understanding.',
    "In these introductory remarks, I can't elaborate further on this topic, but I encourage my reader—who might be used to thinking of experience only as a collection of perceptions and not realizing that it actually gives empirical judgments universal validity, thus requiring a pure and innate unity of understanding—to focus on distinguishing experience from just being a bundle of perceptions. It's important to evaluate the way we prove things with this perspective in mind.",
    "Now we're ready to address Hume's skepticism. He rightly argues that we can't understand how causality works through reason alone — that is, how the existence of one thing necessarily leads to the existence of another thing. I would also say that we understand just as little about the concept of \"subsistence,\" meaning the idea that there must be a fundamental subject at the base of a thing's existence that can't just be a property of something else. In fact, we can't even really conceive how such a thing is possible, even though we can see examples of it in real life. The same confusion applies to how things relate to each other: we have no idea how the condition of one thing can predict or affect the condition of something completely different, and yet how things that exist independently could still somehow depend on each other. However, I strongly disagree with the idea that these concepts come only from experience, or that their perceived necessity is just an illusion caused by habit. On the contrary, I've clearly shown that these concepts and the rules that come from them are firmly established independently of any experience and have real value, at least as far as experience is concerned.",
    "I don't understand how things can exist on their own, act as causes, or be part of a whole independently, and I don't see these features in appearances. These ideas are purely what our mind thinks about them. However, we can understand how ideas connect in our minds and in our reasoning. Ideas can appear as subjects when related to other ideas (predicates), as reasons that lead to outcomes, or as parts that come together to form a complete understanding. We know beforehand that to truly understand something, we need to see it in one of these contexts. Without doing so, we can't be sure we truly grasp what the object is. If we focus on the object as it is by itself, we can't determine it as a substance, a cause, or its relation with others since we can't conceive of that connection. However, the main point is not about things in themselves, but rather how we understand things based on experience, using these categories. We can clearly see why it's not only possible but necessary to use these categories to understand our experiences and make sense of the world.",
    'When experimenting with Hume\'s concept of causation, we start by using logical thinking to form a conditional judgment: one event happens after the other. We might notice a pattern in what we see, like one event always happening after another, but not the other way around. At this point, we can make a hypothetical judgment, such as saying if the sun shines on something long enough, it gets warm. However, this doesn\'t imply a necessary connection yet or define a cause. To turn this observation into a scientific law, it needs to be seen as universally true. For example, we would say, "The sun causes heat with its light." This observation becomes a law, valid for all similar experiences. Thus, we understand the concept of cause as essential to organizing our experiences, even though we can’t fully grasp why a thing acts as a cause. The idea of cause helps us logically connect events based on observations and their order, fitting them into a rule that predicts outcomes.',
    "So, if the basic ideas of the mind don't relate to things we can experience but instead to things that exist beyond experience (called noumena), they don't really mean anything. They basically help us make sense of what we see so we can understand it as actual experience. The rules we get from connecting these ideas to the real world only help us think about things we can observe and learn from. Beyond that, they are just random guesses without any real basis. We can't know if they're even possible just by thinking about them, nor can we prove they apply to anything real, because we need examples from real experiences to understand them. As a result, the things these ideas refer to can only exist in potential experiences.",
    "This solution solves Hume's problem by proving that the pure concepts of understanding come from the mind itself, and it confirms that the universal laws of nature are valid as laws of the mind. However, their use is limited to what we experience because they only make sense when connected to experience. This new perspective, not considered by Hume, suggests that instead of getting these laws from experience, we actually shape our experience based on these laws.",
    "So, everything we've looked into so far shows that all basic principles known before experience (a priori) only relate to possible experiences, not to things as they are by themselves. They only relate to appearances, which are what we experience. This means that both pure mathematics and pure science can only deal with appearances, showing what makes experience possible or what can always be represented in some possible experience.",
    'Finally, we have a clear foundation for all philosophical pursuits, which until now have been both bold and unfocused, trying to tackle everything without clear direction. Neither the philosophically dogmatic thinkers nor those who trusted their common sense realized how close the goal of their efforts was. They started with ideas and principles meant for practical use, not knowing or considering the limits of their understanding because they hadn’t thought about the nature or even the possibility of such pure knowledge.',
    "Many people who think they can understand deep philosophical topics without studying them (I mean those who believe they can make decisions about these topics without any real knowledge) might claim that they figured out long ago, with their common sense, what is being explained here in a complicated way: \"that no matter how much we think, we can never go beyond what we can experience.\" However, if you ask them about their logical beliefs one by one, they'll have to admit that some of these beliefs weren't learned from experience and are valid on their own, without needing proof. So, how can they stop themselves and others who use these beliefs beyond what can be experienced, since they don’t rely on experience? Even this supposedly sensible person, despite his self-assured and easily gained wisdom, isn't immune to getting lost in unrealistic ideas. He often gets deeply caught up in them, even though by calling everything mere guesses or comparisons, he makes his weak claims sound reasonable with his everyday language.",
    'Since the earliest days of philosophy, thinkers have imagined that, in addition to things we can sense (or see)—which make up the physical world—there exist certain creations of the mind, called noumena, forming a world of ideas. Early philosophers often mixed up appearances with illusions (something we can forgive considering the time they lived in), and thus believed that true reality only belonged to these creations of thought.',
    "We agree that everything we perceive through our senses is just an appearance. We acknowledge that these appearances are based on something real, even though we don't understand what this real thing is or how it works. We only know how our senses react to it. This means that while we assume things we see and experience are real, we also agree that something must exist behind these appearances. Therefore, imagining things that form the basis of what we perceive is not only acceptable but also necessary.",
    'Our main conclusion doesn\'t rule out things like noumena; instead, it restricts the principles of Aesthetics (the study of perception) so that they don\'t apply to everything, which would make everything seem like just an appearance. These principles should only apply to things we can potentially experience. This means we recognize objects of understanding but with a strict rule: "We neither know nor can know anything specific about these pure objects of understanding. This is because our pure concepts and intuitions only relate to things we might experience, meaning only to sensory things, and if we move beyond this area, these concepts lose any meaning."',
    "Our basic ideas about understanding can be tempting to use beyond what we actually experience, leading us to apply them in ways that go beyond possible experience. For example, ideas like substance, power, action, and reality don't rely on our senses, and this makes it seem like they might directly apply to things as they truly are, beyond our experience. Adding to this belief, these ideas carry with them a sense of necessity that real-life experiences never fully reach. The idea of cause, for instance, involves a rule that says one event must follow another, but real-life experiences only show us that one event often follows another, not with absolute certainty or necessity.",
    'Therefore, the Categories appear to have a greater significance than just their practical use. As a result, the mind unintentionally extends the realm of experience by adding a larger section filled only with ideas. It does this without realizing that it has overstepped the valid limits of these concepts.',
    "Two important and necessary, though very dry, studies had become essential in the Critique of Pure Reason. These are the two chapters, \"On the Schematism of Pure Concepts of the Understanding,\" and \"On the Basis for Distinguishing All Concepts of Understanding Generally into Phenomena and Noumena.\" The first chapter shows that our senses do not provide pure concepts of understanding directly; instead, they provide a framework for using these concepts, and the appropriate objects show up only in experience (formed by understanding using the senses' materials). The second chapter explains that even though our pure concepts and principles exist independently of experience, they can't actually be used beyond the scope of experience, since all they do is shape the logical form of judgments based on certain experiences. Since we have no insight beyond what our senses tell us, the pure concepts cannot be clearly shown and thus are meaningless. All these noumena, and the so-called intelligible world, are just theoretical issues that can't truly be solved because our understanding doesn't provide direct insight but rather links given experiences together. Experience, therefore, must include all objects for our concepts. Beyond it, the concepts lack any meaning since there's no insight to support them.",
    "We might forgive the imagination for sometimes wandering beyond real-life experiences because these flights make it lively and strong. It's simpler to tone down its boldness than to try to boost its laziness. However, the mind, which should focus on clear thinking, shouldn't be excused for doing the same since we rely on it to help control the imagination when needed.",
    "The mind starts making mistakes very simply and quietly. It begins by explaining basic ideas that it already has before any experience, but these ideas must always be tested through experience. Over time, the mind ignores these limits, creating principles from within itself without restriction. First, it imagines new forces in nature, and then, beings beyond nature; essentially creating a whole world using endless imagination. These concepts aren’t proven by experience but aren't disproven either. This is why young thinkers love deep metaphysical ideas, often wasting their time and talents that could be used more effectively elsewhere.",
    "Trying to limit these pointless attempts of pure reason by warning about tough questions, complaining about our understanding limits, or dismissing our claims as just guesses won't help. Unless we clearly demonstrate that these efforts are impossible and turn our understanding of reason itself into a solid science, where we can clearly differentiate its right use from its useless one, these futile efforts will continue.",
    'How can Nature itself exist or be understood?',
    'This question, which is the ultimate goal of transcendental philosophy and marks its limit and completion, actually consists of two questions.',
    "First: How do we understand nature from a material standpoint, thinking of it as everything we can observe? How do space, time, and everything within them—the basis of our senses—exist? The answer is: It's due to how our Sensibility is designed to be specifically influenced by objects that are, in themselves, unknown to it and entirely separate from these appearances. This is explained in the Critique itself in the transcendental Aesthetic and in these Prolegomena with the solution to the first general problem.",
    'Secondly: How can we understand nature as a complete set of rules that all phenomena must follow for us to connect them in our experience? The answer is that this is only possible because of the way our minds work. All our sensory experiences are automatically connected to our consciousness, and we think by following rules. This allows us to have experiences, but it is different from truly understanding the things themselves. This response is provided in the Critique through transcendental Logic and explained in these Prolegomena while solving the second main problem.',
    "We can't break down or explain in simple terms how our ability to sense things, understand them, and be aware of them works, because we rely on these abilities to think about and make sense of everything.",
    "There are many natural laws that we only know through experience. However, the idea that nature follows laws can't be learned from experience because experience itself depends on these fundamental laws that exist before we even have any experiences.",
    "The ability to experience things is also the universal law of nature. The rules of our experiences are actually nature's laws. We only know nature through how it appears to us, meaning we understand it through our own perceptions. Therefore, we can only figure out how these perceptions are connected based on how they come together in our minds, which makes experiencing them possible.",
    "The main idea in this section—that we can know the universal laws of nature without experiencing them—naturally leads to the idea that these laws come from ourselves, specifically from our understanding. Instead of using experience to find these laws in nature, we should understand that nature's universal laws are based on the conditions of our ability to experience things, which exist in our senses and understanding. Otherwise, how could we know these laws ahead of time, since they aren't just logical conclusions but genuine additions to our knowledge?",
    "The necessary alignment between the principles of possible experience and the laws of nature can come from one of two reasons: either we learn these laws from nature through experience, or nature itself is based on the general laws that make experience possible. The first reason doesn't make sense because the universal laws of nature must be known independently of experience and must form the basis for all use of understanding that comes from experience. So, only the second reason is possible.",
    'We should differentiate between empirical laws of nature, which rely on specific observations, and pure or universal laws of nature, which do not depend on such observations but only on the conditions that make their consistent connection in experience possible. For the latter, nature and possible experience are basically identical. Since these laws depend on the necessary connection of events in our experience (which is essential for us to recognize any object in the physical world) and on the fundamental laws of understanding, it might initially seem odd but is still true to say:',
    'The mind does not get its rules from nature beforehand; instead, it gives rules to nature.',
    "Let's explain this seemingly bold idea with an example. It will show that the laws we find in things we perceive through our senses (especially when we think of these laws as necessary) are usually believed to be created by our understanding, even though they are very similar to natural laws that we learn about from experience.",
    "If we look at the properties of a circle, we see that it has unique characteristics that are consistent in many ways. The question is whether these rules are inherent to the circle itself or if they are applied by us when we create the circle based on its radii. For example, no matter how you draw two straight lines that intersect a circle, the product of the lengths of the segments of one line will always equal the product of the segments of the other line. Is this rule a property of the circle, or is it something we establish when we decide how the circle should be constructed? When we understand how this rule works, it's clear it comes from how we understand the concept of a circle being defined by equal radii.\n\nIf we expand this idea and consider a circle as a type of conic section (a category that includes ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas), we'll find similar rules about the segments of intersecting lines. Although the products of the segments are not always equal in these shapes, they maintain a consistent ratio. \n\nGoing further into physical astronomy, we find a universal rule about gravity: it weakens with the square of the distance from the source of gravity. This rule seems to naturally exist in the universe. It's based on the concept of how the force is spread across spherical areas. The outcomes of this rule are so significant and uniform that they dictate that the paths of planets and stars are conic sections, and no other rule of attraction but the inverse square law can describe a functioning cosmic system.",
    'Here, we have a nature governed by laws that are understood through reasoning and mainly from basic rules about space. Now I ask:',
    'Do the laws of nature exist in space for us to discover, or do they exist in our minds as we learn to understand and organize our experiences of space based on our concepts?',
    "Space is very uniform and doesn't have specific properties on its own, so we wouldn't look for natural laws there. However, it's the understanding that shapes space into forms like circles, cones, or spheres, because it holds the basis for unifying these shapes.",
    "Space, which is the basic framework for how we perceive things, forms the foundation for all specific perceptions. This framework allows us to understand and organize different perceptions. However, the unity and order of objects come from our minds, which apply their own rules to organize and understand experiences. Therefore, our minds create the structure of the natural world by grouping and categorizing everything we perceive. This process happens before we even have experiences, shaping them with predefined rules. It's important to note that we're focusing on the world as we can experience it, not on the world as it exists independently of us. Our minds make it possible to have experiences in the first place, and in doing so, they assert that what we perceive must follow universal laws, making it part of nature.",
    'Appendix to the Pure Science of Nature.',
    'Section 39: On the System of Categories.',
    "For a philosopher, there is nothing more appealing than being able to gather and organize all the various ideas or principles they've come across in practical use from a single basic principle. This allows them to combine everything into one understanding. Initially, they might have thought that simply grouping things that seemed similar after some analysis was enough to form a complete understanding. However, this was just a collection of ideas. Now, they realize that only a specific number of concepts, no more and no less, can truly form a way of understanding things. They see the importance of organizing these ideas, which leads to a complete understanding, and now, they have created a System.",
    "The process of identifying concepts in our everyday thinking that don't come from specific experiences but are present in all our understanding is similar to figuring out the basic rules of a language. This doesn't require more reflection or deeper understanding than simplifying a language to develop its grammar. Both tasks are closely related, although we may not be able to explain why each language has its specific structure or why there are exactly a certain number of these basic structures within it.",
    "Aristotle grouped ten basic concepts and called them Categories. Later, he added five more concepts, known as post-predicaments, though some of them were already covered by the original ten. This collection was just a starting point for future thinkers, rather than a fully developed theory. Nowadays, with the progress in philosophy, it's seen as outdated and unhelpful.",
    "After thinking about the basic elements of human knowledge, I eventually managed to clearly separate the basic ideas related to our Sensibility (like space and time) from those related to our Understanding. This meant that the 7th, 8th, and 9th Categories had to be removed from the old list, and the others didn't help me either because they didn't offer a way to fully explore and precisely define all the functions that generate pure concepts from the understanding.",
    'To find a principle, I searched for a mental action that includes all others, and just differs in how it changes a variety of ideas into unified thoughts. I discovered this mental action was judging. Logicians had already worked on this idea, even though it still had flaws. With their work, I could make a full list of the basic functions of our understanding, which are not tied to any particular thing. I linked these functions of judging to objects in general, or to conditions where judgments are valid, leading to pure concepts of understanding. I was sure that these concepts, and only these, make up our entire knowledge of things through pure understanding. I called them Categories, using an old term, but I also created a list called "Predicables," which shows all possible concepts you can make from them by combining them, or with space and time, or with what we sense but haven\'t yet specifically identified. This work is part of developing a system of transcendental philosophy, which I\'m working on in the Critique of Pure Reason.',
    "The key difference in this system of categories, which sets it apart from the old, unorganized collection without any clear principle, is this: it allows us to precisely identify the true meaning of pure concepts of understanding and how they should be used. It becomes clear that these concepts are merely logical operations, which don't actually create any concept of an object by themselves. They need some sensory information as a foundation. So, they are used only to refine empirical judgments, which would otherwise be vague and not specific to any logical operation. This gives these judgments universal validity and makes it possible to create solid judgments based on experience.",
    "Understanding how these categories work and realizing they're only useful when applied to real experiences was not something the original creator, nor those who followed, ever thought of. Without this understanding, which comes from figuring out where they come from, these categories are useless—just a frustrating list of names with no guidance on how to use them. If ancient thinkers had grasped this idea, the study of abstract knowledge, known as metaphysics, wouldn't have confused so many intelligent people over the centuries. Instead, it would have helped human understanding grow instead of leading it into pointless and confusing ideas that make real science difficult.",
    "This way of categorizing things makes it easier to systematically analyze any object using pure reason. It guides us on what to focus on to fully explore metaphysical topics, covering all the possible ways the mind can think about concepts. Similarly, we have a table of principles whose completeness is guaranteed by these categories. Even when we divide concepts that go beyond basic understanding, the process remains consistent, always following the same guidelines derived from our natural thinking abilities. There's no doubt that we can fully understand a pure thought of the mind or reason if we evaluate it philosophically using these fundamental principles. That's why I couldn't ignore this method when dealing with one of the most abstract topics in philosophy, like distinguishing between the ideas of 'something' and 'nothing'. Accordingly, I created a necessary table to organize these ideas (as seen in Critique, p. 207).",
    "This system, like any true system based on universal principles, is incredibly valuable because it keeps out unrelated ideas that might mix with the core ideas of understanding and clarifies where each idea belongs. Concepts called \"concepts of reflection\" have been wrongly included with the core ideas of understanding. They actually connect ideas about objects themselves, not just compare already known ideas, so they're of a different kind and are used differently. My organized system helps prevent this mix-up. The importance of my special list of categories becomes clearer when we separate reason's complex ideas from the basic understanding ideas since they are different in nature and origin and need to be treated differently. This crucial separation hasn't been made in any metaphysical system, where complex ideas are typically mixed up with basic ones like siblings, which happened because there was no clear system of categories.",

    'How is metaphysics as a whole possible?',
    'No text found between the delimiters',
    "Pure mathematics and pure science didn't need the kind of simplification we provided for understanding and security because each already has its own reliability. Mathematics is based on its own proofs, while science relies on both understanding and thorough experience. Physics can't completely ignore this because, despite its certainty, it's not as precise as mathematics. Thus, both fields needed this review, not for themselves, but to support another field: metaphysics.",
    "Metaphysics deals with ideas not just about the natural world, which can be experienced, but also with pure rational ideas that can't be experienced in reality. Therefore, it's hard to prove or disprove these ideas through experience. This part of metaphysics is crucial because it focuses on understanding these purely rational ideas, and it needs to be justified for its own sake. The main challenge in metaphysics is how Reason examines itself and claims to understand things directly from its own ideas without needing experience to back them up.",
    "Reason is never truly validated without addressing this problem. Using reason purely for practical, everyday understanding doesn't fully achieve its true purpose. Each individual experience only represents a part of its entire scope, but the complete total of all possible experiences isn't really an experience itself. Still, solving this issue is crucial for reason, and thinking about it demands concepts different from those we use for our daily experiences. These regular concepts just help us make sense of what we encounter, but the concepts of reason strive for complete unity across all possible experiences, going beyond any single experience. This is why they are considered transcendent.",
    "Just like our understanding needs categories to make sense of experiences, our reason has its own set of ideas. These are essential concepts that we can't directly experience. These ideas are a natural part of how reason works, just as categories are for understanding. The categories might trick us and lead us astray, while the ideas can also be misleading, but we can learn to manage them and not be fooled.",
    "All illusions happen when we mistakenly believe our personal opinions are objective facts. The only way to prevent the errors of reason is through self-awareness, especially when we use our reason in an exaggerated way. It's important to remember that reason should focus on itself and guide us from within, rather than misapplying its purpose to external objects.",
    'Understanding the difference between ideas, which are pure concepts of reason, and categories, which are pure concepts of the understanding, is crucial. These concepts come from different areas and have different origins and uses. Without distinguishing between them, creating a comprehensive science of knowledge gained independently of experience (a priori cognitions) is impossible. Without this distinction, metaphysics becomes a blurry and ineffective effort—like trying to build a structure without knowing what materials to use or how to use them correctly. The Critique of Pure Reason significantly advanced our understanding of metaphysics by highlighting this difference. It has provided better guidance in exploring metaphysical questions than all previous attempts that failed, because they mistakenly treated the concepts of understanding and reason as the same.',
    "All clear understandings of concepts can be seen and proven through experience. However, higher-level thoughts or ideas that come from pure reasoning cannot appear in or be tested by experience. So, any mistakes that occur in this kind of reasoning can only be found by using pure reasoning itself, which is challenging. This is because our reasoning is naturally filled with arguments based on ideas that can be misleading. This unavoidable confusion can't be fixed by researching real-world things; it can only be addressed by looking into our own reasoning as the source of these ideas.",
    "In the Critique of Pure Reason, I made a big effort to clearly identify different types of knowledge and trace their concepts back to their shared origins. By understanding where these concepts come from, I could safely determine how to use them and make sure I've covered all the bases in listing and categorizing these concepts beforehand, based on solid principles. Without doing this, metaphysics would just be a disorganized jumble where no one knows if anything’s missing or fully understood. We can only achieve this benefit in pure philosophy, but it’s the core of what pure philosophy is all about.",
    'Since I had discovered the source of categories in the four logical functions of all judgments of understanding, it made sense to look for the source of ideas in the three functions of logical reasoning. Once these pure concepts of reason (also known as transcendental ideas) are identified, they are unlikely to come from anywhere other than the reasoning itself. This reasoning, when it focuses on form, makes up the logical part of arguments, and when it involves understanding judgments beforehand, forms the transcendental concepts of pure reason.',
    'The classification of syllogisms requires them to be divided into categorical, hypothetical, and disjunctive types. Based on these, the concepts of reason include: the idea of a complete subject (the substantial), the concept of a complete series of conditions, and the understanding of a complete set of possibilities. The first idea relates to psychology, the second to cosmology, and the third to theology. Each contributes to Dialectics in its own way, leading to the division of the entire Dialectics of pure reason into Paralogism, Antinomy, and Ideal. This breakdown ensures that all aspects of pure reason are fully covered, showing that none are missing, because it provides a thorough view of the faculty of reason from which they originate.',
    "In general, it's interesting to note that the ideas that come from reason are different from basic concepts; they aren't really useful for understanding our experiences and can even get in the way of using reason to understand nature. However, in some other way, which we haven't figured out yet, they are necessary. Whether the soul is a simple substance or not doesn't matter when we are trying to explain its behavior, because we can't understand the idea of a simple being from our real-life experiences. This idea is empty when it comes to figuring out the causes of what we see, and it can't help us explain anything we experience internally or externally. Similarly, questions about whether the world began at some point or has always existed don't help us explain current events in the world. We should also avoid explaining nature's design as something created by a Supreme Being because that wouldn't be true natural philosophy; it would mean we've reached the limits of our understanding. The use of these ideas is different from basic concepts that are essential for making sense of experiences in the first place. Our detailed study of understanding would be pointless if we only aimed to know nature as we experience it; reason works fine in math and science without these complex explanations. Our review of understanding works together with pure reason for purposes beyond what can be experienced. While we previously said this might not make sense, reason and understanding must work together, with reason improving understanding without disrupting it.",
    'The answer to this question is as follows: Pure reason doesn\'t actually point to specific things beyond our experiences. Instead, it just wants us to fully use our understanding within the world we know. However, this completeness only applies to principles, not to concrete insights or specific objects. To clearly express ideas, reason forms them as if it were understanding an actual object. In terms of these rules, the understanding is fully worked out, but the "object" is just an idea created to help make our understanding as complete as possible.',
    'Introduction to the Logic of Pure Reason.',
    'In sections 33 and 34 above, we discussed how using the categories (basic concepts or classifications) without mixing them with sensory experiences can lead reason to incorrectly apply them beyond real-life experiences to things as they are on their own. However, because these categories don\'t have any direct sensory meaning, they act only as logical functions. They can describe a general idea of a thing but can\'t define anything specifically on their own. These exaggerated concepts are called Noümena, or pure thought beings. For example, you might think of "substance" without considering its existence over time, or "cause" without considering it happening in time, and so on. Here, we apply standards that make sense for understanding real experiences to concepts that were never meant to be understood this way, removing all the necessary context that gives these concepts purpose or meaning.',
    'The mind doesn\'t naturally wander into imaginary concepts without some external influence. However, when our reason desires more than what we can observe and seeks to finish the chain of conditions, it pushes the mind past its usual limits. This means it can start imagining experiences that extend beyond what we can actually grasp, and even seeks out new ideas, known as "noumena," to connect this chain. These result in "transcendental ideas," which, while seemingly aiming for more realistic goals, actually trick the mind into using them in ways that go beyond what can be experienced. This misleading use is hard to control without scientific learning and effort.',
    'The Psychological Concept.',
    "People have noticed for a long time that in all things, the core part that stays the same after all the characteristics are taken away is unknown. Many have complained about the limits of our knowledge because of this. However, it's important to understand that it's not the fault of human understanding that we can't know the true essence of things. Instead, the problem is expecting to know this essence as if it were a clear and defined object. Pure reason asks us to find a base for every property a thing has, and for that base, another base, and so on indefinitely. Therefore, we should not consider anything we find as the ultimate base, and we can never truly understand the core substance of things, no matter how much we study them, even if all secrets of nature were revealed to us. This is because our way of understanding involves thinking in steps, using concepts and characteristics, and so we always miss the absolute core. As a result, all the real qualities we use to understand things, like their hardness, are just temporary features. Even hardness itself is just something we understand as resulting from a power, whose source is unknown to us.",
    "In our consciousness, we think we have a clear sense of the essence of ourselves. It feels like we know it immediately because all our thoughts refer back to us as the thinker, and we can't imagine ourselves as part of anything else. We expect that we can use what we know about ourselves to fully understand who we are as a complete and separate being. However, this expectation is misleading. The \"self\" isn't a concept we can define; it's just a reference point for how we experience our inner thoughts without additional attributes. Therefore, the self cannot describe or be defined by anything else, nor can it be a concrete understanding of who we truly are. It's just how our experiences relate back to an unknown essence. The idea that we fully understand our thinking nature is often misunderstood and leads to the false belief that we can know about our inner self beyond what we experience. This misunderstanding can also help dismiss any simplistic explanations of the mind that rely solely on physical descriptions.",
    "Even though we might refer to the thinking self (or the soul) as a substance, since it's the core of our thoughts and can't be described as a quality of something else, it's still meaningless unless we can show that it has permanence, which is what makes the idea of substances useful in real-life experience.",
    "The idea that something exists permanently can't be proven when thinking about it as a standalone concept; it's only applicable when we consider experiences. This is clearly shown in the first Analogy of Experience. Anyone who disagrees can try to prove that a subject, which isn't a part of something else, exists permanently and can't be naturally created or destroyed. Such statements can't be proven on their own, only when they're related to things we might experience.",
    "If we want to argue that the soul is permanent based on the idea that it's a type of substance, this only makes sense when we're talking about what we can experience, not the soul as something beyond experience. Since life is when we can have experiences, we can only say the soul is permanent during life. When a person dies, any experience related to the soul as we know it ends, unless we can prove otherwise, which is exactly the question we're exploring. Therefore, the idea that the soul is permanent can only be proven during a person's life—not after death—because the idea of a substance being permanent only applies to what we can experience.",
    "There is something real outside of us that matches our perceptions, but this is true only for the sake of our experiences, not because of any inherent reality. Essentially, some events in space can be proven to exist because we rely only on things we can experience. Anything beyond our experience doesn’t exist for us. What we perceive in space is real for us, and everything that happens in space is part of our experiences that follow certain laws, proving their reality just like our inner experiences prove the existence of our soul. Through experiences outside of us, we understand that physical objects are real, similar to how we know our soul exists through internal experiences. Yet, we only know our soul through our experiences, and we don't understand its essence. Cartesian idealism distinguishes real experiences from dreams, assuming space and time are the conditions for objects to exist. It questions if the things we see when awake are actually real, as real as the soul is in time. But we can easily resolve these doubts by checking if experiences follow the universal laws of experience. If they do, they must be real. So, it's just as evident that physical objects exist outside us as it is that we ourselves exist over time. The term 'outside us' simply means 'in space.' However, the statement \"I am\" refers not just to the internal experience but also to consciousness itself, just like 'body' refers to the external experience and the essence behind it. Thus, asking if bodies exist outside our thoughts is similar to asking if we exist without representing ourselves in time, and both are answered negatively. This understanding cancels out material idealism. If space is just how we perceive things, then it's as real as our own existence, only its empirical reality matters. But if space and the things in it exist outside us, nothing beyond what we perceive can prove their reality.",
    'II. The Idea of the Universe',
    'This result of using pure reason beyond normal limits is its most interesting feature. It acts as a strong motivator to wake philosophy from its complacency and pushes it to take on the challenging job of evaluating reason itself.',
    "I call this concept \"cosmological\" because it always focuses on things from the physical world that we can see and sense, so it doesn't go beyond that into pure imagination. It sticks to what we can perceive and doesn't deal with abstract ideas like the soul as something simple that can't be sensed. However, the cosmological concept stretches the link between something dependent and what it depends on (whether through math or through forces) to a point that experience can never fully match. In this way, it is always an idea with elements that can't be fully experienced in reality.",
    "Firstly, the need for a system of categories becomes very clear here. Even if there weren't other proofs, this alone would show that it's essential in the system of pure reason. There are only four main transcendent ideas because there are four main types of categories, and each of them relates to the total completeness of the conditions needed for a given situation. Similarly, there are also four types of dialectical arguments in pure reason, and because they are dialectical, each one has an opposing argument based on equally convincing reasons. No amount of philosophical precision can resolve this conflict, which forces philosophers to go back to the origins of pure reason itself. This Antinomy isn't made up on a whim; it's based on the nature of human reason and is unavoidable and ongoing. It includes four main arguments along with their opposing arguments:",

    "Here's an unusual aspect of human reason that doesn't appear in any other context. When we habitually think of the appearances of the physical world as actual things in themselves, and assume that the rules governing them apply universally—not just in our experiences—we encounter a surprising conflict that can't be resolved in the usual straightforward way. This happens because both sides of the argument can be supported by equally strong and convincing evidence. I'm confident this is true for all the proofs involved. As a result, reason finds itself in conflict, something that makes skeptics happy but leaves thoughtful philosophers uneasy.",
    "In metaphysics, we can make mistakes in many ways without worrying about being proven wrong, as long as we avoid contradicting ourselves. This is because when we talk about ideas that can't be fully experienced or proven, we can't be contradicted by experience. For instance, we can't determine through experience whether the universe has always existed or if it began at a certain point, or whether matter can be divided endlessly or is made up of simple parts. These concepts aren't something we can fully explore or prove through experience, so we can't use experience to confirm or disprove either side of these arguments.",
    'The only way that reason could accidentally reveal its secret tricks, which are wrongly claimed to be absolute truths, is if it used a widely accepted idea to support a point and then, with perfect logic, reached the opposite conclusion using another equally accepted idea. This is exactly what happens with four natural ideas of reason, leading to four statements on one side and four opposing statements on the other, all based on principles everyone agrees on. By using these principles, they uncover the confusing tricks of pure reason that would otherwise stay hidden forever.',
    "This experiment aims to reveal any mistakes in our basic assumptions. Opposite statements can't both be false unless the idea they're based on is impossible. For example, the statements \"a square circle is round\" and \"a square circle is not round\" are both false. The first is false because a circle can't be square, and the second is false because if it's a circle, it can't be angular. This means that if assuming an idea makes both opposite statements false, then that idea is impossible and doesn't actually mean anything.",
    'The first two contradictions, which I call mathematical because they deal with adding or dividing similar things, are based on a self-contradictory idea. This is why I explain how it turns out that both sides of the argument in these two cases are incorrect.',
    "When I talk about objects in time and space, I'm not referring to the things themselves, of which I know nothing, but to things as they appear to us through our experiences. I can't claim that something I think about in time or space actually exists independently of my thoughts because that would contradict myself. Space and time, plus the things we see within them, don't exist independently. They are just ways we interpret reality. So, it's clearly contradictory to say that something which is just a way of representing reality exists on its own without our representation. Therefore, objects we sense only exist through experience, and suggesting otherwise means pretending that experience happens without experience itself.",
    "If I try to figure out the size of the world in terms of space and time, it's impossible to say whether it’s infinite or finite based on what we know. We can't truly experience infinite space, infinite time, or even the edges of the world leading to empty space or time, because these are just ideas we have. The size of the world should be understood as existing independently of our experiences. This goes against the idea that the world is just a collection of things we perceive, as our perceptions are only experiences, not real objects. So, saying the world definitely exists as infinite or finite doesn’t make sense and is always incorrect.",
    'The same applies to the second antinomy, which deals with breaking down what we perceive. Since our perceptions are just representations in our minds, their parts only exist when we experience or perceive them. This means any division is limited to our experience. Saying that an object, like a body, contains all its parts before we perceive it assumes it exists outside of our experience, which is incorrect. This would mean that perceptions exist before we actually experience them. This idea contradicts itself, as does any attempt to solve this misunderstood issue, whether we argue that objects are made of infinitely many parts or a limited number of simple parts.',
    'In the first type of contradictions (the mathematical kind), the mistake is in showing something that contradicts itself as if it made sense (treating an illusion as a real thing). In the second type (the dynamical kind), the mistake is in showing something as conflicting when it actually can work together; so in the first type, both opposing statements are false. However, in the second type, where the disagreement comes from a simple misunderstanding, both statements can be true.',
    "Any mathematical connection requires that the things being linked are similar in terms of size or magnitude. In contrast, a dynamic connection doesn't need this similarity. When dealing with extended magnitudes, all parts must be similar to each other and to the whole. However, when it comes to the connection between cause and effect, there might be similarity, but it's not essential, because the idea of causality allows one thing to cause another, even if they are completely different.",
    "If we think of the things we sense in the world as they truly are and consider natural laws as applying directly to these true things, we'd face a conflict. Similarly, if we treated freedom like it's just another appearance, we'd again find a contradiction because we'd be saying something could be both true and not true about the same thing. However, if we see natural laws as only applying to appearances and freedom as applying to things as they truly are, there is no contradiction. Both natural causality and freedom can coexist, even if it's hard, or even impossible, to fully understand how freedom works.",
    "Every event we see is something happening in time, and it always follows a consistent natural law where something caused it first. This cause must also be something that starts to happen; otherwise, there'd be no order between the cause and effect. If the cause and effect always existed without starting, they'd be timeless. So, the cause must have begun to act at some point, making it an event itself, like its effect, which also needs a cause. This forms the basis of natural law, which dictates how causes and effects occur. \n\nIf freedom is a feature of certain causes, it means these causes can start events on their own, without needing anything else to trigger them. But for this to happen, the cause can’t be tied to time or appearances; it has to be thought of as its true essence, while its effects are what we perceive. If we can imagine beings of pure understanding influencing what we see without contradicting these ideas, then everything in the observable world stays under natural laws. At the same time, these causes that aren't seen as appearances (but as the essence of those appearances) can be considered free. Thus, the same thing can have both natural laws and freedom, but viewed differently—one as it appears, and the other as it truly is.",
    "We have a capability within us, known as reason, which is connected to both personal motives (natural causes of actions) and external ideals (ideas that guide this capability). This connection is captured by the word \"ought.\" When we view a person as guided by reason, they aren't just a sensory being; they possess a deeper quality we can't entirely grasp: how this \"ought,\" which hasn't yet happened, drives actions that have real-world consequences. Here, reason means freedom when influencing the real world, as it doesn't rely on personal conditions like time or nature's laws. Instead, reason dictates actions universally, guided by principles regardless of time or place.",
    "What I'm providing here is just an example to help explain the concept and isn't necessarily related to the problem we're discussing, which should be solved based on ideas alone, without relying on real-world characteristics.",
    "I can confidently say that the actions of rational beings, when seen as events in any experience, follow the rules of nature. However, when looking purely at the rational side of those beings, their actions are actually free. Nature's necessity simply requires that every event in the world can be understood through consistent rules, due to its cause. Even though we might not fully understand the deeper causes, nature's rules still apply, whether a rational being's actions are driven by reason and therefore free, or driven by something else. If actions are based on reason, they follow certain principles, and the outcomes obey consistent laws. If not based on reason, they follow natural sensibility laws. In either case, the results are consistent. So, even when reason causes these natural rules, it's free; when it doesn't, nature's rules still apply, yet reason remains unaffected and free. So, freedom doesn't hinder natural laws, nor do these laws cancel the freedom of reason linked to deeper causes.",
    "Practical freedom means that our reason can cause actions based on objective reasons, while still aligning with natural laws. This idea helps us understand how transcendental freedom can coexist with natural necessity. When a being acts based on objective reasons, that action is a new start but is also part of a larger sequence of events. Each action is determined by a prior state, forming a chain. In rational beings, it’s possible to start a sequence of actions from within oneself without breaking natural laws because these decisions aren't bound by time in the same way that physical causes are. The reasoning behind our actions doesn't happen before the actions themselves because the cause is based on things that aren't confined by time. Hence, an action can be free from the perspective of reasoning but still follow natural laws when viewed as a sequence of events.",
    'The fourth antinomy is resolved the same way as the conflict in the third. If we separate the cause we see in the appearance from the cause of the appearance itself (thinking of it as a thing by itself), both statements can be reconciled. One statement says that there is no absolutely necessary cause in the physical world as we see it. The other says that this world is still linked to a necessary being as its cause, but this cause is of a different type and follows a different rule. The apparent contradiction arises from mistakenly applying rules that only apply to appearances to things as they truly are and mixing up the two ideas.',
    "This is the proposition and solution to the contradiction that reason encounters when applying its principles to the physical world. Understanding this proposition alone is helpful for our knowledge of human reasoning, even if the solution doesn't completely satisfy the reader. That's because it's challenging to dismiss a natural misunderstanding that the reader has only recently realized wasn't true. However, one thing is clear: it's impossible to avoid this conflict of reason with itself as long as we regard physical objects as things in themselves rather than mere appearances. This forces the reader to re-examine how we derive and prove our knowledge that doesn’t come from direct experience, which is what I want for now. As the reader delves into the nature of pure reason, the concepts that resolve the conflict of reason will become familiar. Without this preparation, I don't expect even attentive readers to completely agree.",
    'III. The Religious Concept.',
    "The third transcendental Idea is the idea of pure reason, which is important but can lead to errors when used only theoretically. Unlike the psychological and cosmological Ideas that start from experience and overreach, this idea breaks away from experience entirely. It is based on concepts of what makes something absolutely complete, using the idea of a most perfect original Being to discuss how all other things are possible and real. This idea is not part of experience itself but helps us understand the connections, order, and unity of our experiences. It's clearer to see here than in earlier cases that we can confuse what we think with reality itself, and turn what is just a necessary idea for our understanding into an absolute truth. The Critique's views on transcendental theology are clear and conclusive, so there's nothing more I need to add.",
    'General Thoughts on Transcendental Ideas.',
    "Many things we experience are hard to understand, and we can't always answer questions that arise from those experiences, like why objects are attracted to each other. But when we move away from real-world experiences into the realm of pure ideas, we can't claim things are beyond understanding. Here, we're dealing with ideas that come from our own reasoning, not from nature, so any problems we encounter must be solvable. Concepts like psychological, cosmological, and theological ideas are purely from reason and aren't based on experience. The questions we ask about them come from our own reasoning, seeking to satisfy itself. These questions should be answered by showing that they are principles that help us use our understanding in a complete and unified way, and they only apply to the entirety of our experiences.",
    "Even though we can't have a complete experience of everything, thinking of knowledge as a complete system can give our understanding a special kind of unity. Without this system, our knowledge is just a collection of unrelated details and can't be used to prove any ultimate purpose. This applies not just to practical ideas but also to the highest goals of theoretical reasoning.",
    'The transcendental ideas show how reason helps us understand things in an organized way. However, if we mistakenly think that this organized way is directly connected to the things we are trying to understand, and if we confuse the guiding role of these ideas with a creative one, believing that they can help us know things beyond what we can actually experience, then we are misunderstanding how reason should be used. This misunderstanding leads to confusion in using our reason practically and causes our reason to conflict with itself.',
    'In summary.',
    'On Setting the Limits of Pure Reason.',
    "After presenting the clearest arguments, it would be silly for us to think we can know more about something than what we can possibly experience about it, or to claim any knowledge about anything that isn't something we can potentially experience. How could we decide anything like that when time, space, and our basic mental categories—or even any concepts we create through experience or perception—only serve to make experiences possible? If we ignore this condition with our pure understanding, these concepts don’t define anything and are meaningless.",
    'However, it would be even more ridiculous to deny the existence of things as they truly are, or to assume that our experiences are the only way to know things. It would also be foolish to believe that our perception of them in space and time is the only way or that our way of understanding is the best possible one. Essentially, it would be wrong to claim that the principles that make our experiences possible are universal laws for things as they really are.',
    "Our rules, which limit the use of reason to what we can experience, might end up being stretched beyond their true purpose, and the limits of our understanding treated as the limits of how things can actually be (like in Hume's dialogues), unless we carefully examine these boundaries to prevent overreaching claims. Skepticism originally came from metaphysics and its overly free discussions. Initially, skepticism might have dismissed anything beyond empirical reason as useless and misleading; however, as it became clear that the same principles used in actual experience could logically lead beyond what we could observe, people started to doubt even concrete experiences. There's nothing to worry about here, though, because common sense will likely always prevail. Still, some confusion began in science about how much we can rely on reason and why it can go only so far. To resolve this confusion and prevent future misunderstandings, we need to clearly define the limits of using reason.",
    "We can't fully understand what things are like on their own, beyond what we've experienced. But that doesn't mean we should stop trying to learn about them. Our experiences often leave us with more questions then answers, and these questions only lead to more curiosity. This is clear when we think about pure reason, which makes us ask deep questions. Once we understand that our soul can't be explained just by physical stuff, we naturally want to know what the soul truly is. If experience can't give us the answer, we turn to reason, thinking of the soul as something simple and non-physical, even though we can't prove it's real. In questions about how long the world has existed, how big it is, or whether we have free will or everything happens naturally, answers based on experience only lead to more questions. This shows that physical explanations aren't enough for our reasoning. Who doesn't notice how dependent all our thoughts and beliefs are on mere experience, suggesting it's impossible to stop thinking there? Despite being told not to think about ideas beyond experience, we feel driven to find peace in the idea of a Being that we can't fully understand or disprove, because without it, our reasoning seems incomplete.",
    "When talking about large objects, boundaries suggest there's space around them, like a container. Limits, on the other hand, are simply the absence of more, meaning something isn't totally whole. Our minds tend to imagine a space where we can understand things as they really are, even though we can never truly grasp them and are stuck perceiving only their appearances.",
    "As long as the thinking process of reason is similar, it's hard to imagine any clear limits to it. In fields like math and science, human reasoning has limits, but it doesn't really have ultimate ends. While there are things that reason can never fully grasp, it doesn't reach a final stopping point within its own progression. Our understanding in math can keep growing, and there are endless possibilities for new discoveries, just as we can endlessly discover new features, powers, and laws of nature through ongoing experience and logical thinking. We can't confuse this endless progress, since math deals only with things we can perceive through the senses. Things like moral concepts or metaphysics fall outside its realm; they can't be reached by math nor are they needed by it. Thus, math doesn't steadily lead us toward these fields, nor is there a meeting point between them. Similarly, science won't unveil the deeper nature of things that help us understand appearances, because science doesn't need it for its explanations. Even if other sources suggest reasons (like the influence of immaterial beings), such explanations should be ignored; they shouldn't be part of scientific reasoning. Science should rely only on things that can be sensed and connected to real experiences and empirical laws.",
    "Metaphysics guides us to the limits of pure reasoning through thoughtful contemplation, driven by the nature of reason itself, not by random decision. The transcendental Ideas don't let us ignore them, and although they can't be fully realized, they help us understand the limits of reason and how to define them. This is the purpose of our natural inclination towards reason, which has created metaphysics as its favorite pursuit. Like everything else in the world, metaphysics isn't a product of random chance but is naturally organized for important purposes. It's a fundamental aspect of our nature, more than any other science, and isn't a result of random choice or experiences, which are entirely different.",
    "Reason, with all its ideas and rules for understanding the world we can sense, is never fully satisfied. This is because new questions keep popping up that we can't completely answer. The big questions that aim to complete our understanding are called transcendental ideas. However, it's clear that the world we see and feel can never fully answer these questions. Concepts like space and time, which help us understand the world we sense, don't quite get there. The world we sense is just a series of events linked by universal rules; it doesn't stand alone and isn't the ultimate reality. It's only a series of appearances that point to something deeper, which are things we can't just see or measure, but must understand as they truly are. Understanding these deeper things is where reason can hope to find complete answers, moving from what's dependent on something else to understanding its true cause.",
    "Earlier in sections 33 and 34, we outlined the limits of reason when it comes to understanding ideas that are purely products of thought. Now, because these deep ideas encourage us to explore them, they lead us to the point where our experiences (the things we know) meet the unknown (things we cannot know, called \"noumena\"). Here, we can figure out the boundaries of pure reason. Boundaries always involve something positive, like how a surface marks the edge of physical space, a line defines the boundary of the surface, or a point marks the end of the line. But limits are purely negative. The limits mentioned earlier aren't enough because beyond them, something still exists, even though we can't truly know what it is. The question is, how does our reason relate what we know to what we will never know? This creates a real link between something we understand and something we don't—and that unknown will always remain a mystery. Still, we must have a clear idea of this connection, even if the unknown never becomes any clearer to us.",
    'We must accept that there are things beyond our senses, like an immaterial being, a world of understanding, and a Supreme Being, even though they are just concepts. These concepts provide reason with the completeness and satisfaction it cannot find in simply understanding the physical world around us. This is because appearances always hint at something different and separate from themselves, implying the existence of an object in itself, whether we can know more about it or not.',
    "We can't truly understand these beings of intellect in their pure form, but we have to assume that they have a connection to the physical world through reason. We can imagine this connection using concepts that relate them to our sensory world. However, if we try to imagine these beings using only pure concepts, we don't actually come up with a clear idea, so our concept has no real meaning. But if we think of them with characteristics borrowed from the sensory world, they stop being purely intellectual and become part of our sensory world. Let's consider this in terms of the idea of a Supreme Being.",
    "Our idea of a higher power is a clear idea of logic, but it only imagines something that includes all possibilities without clearly defining any of them. To define one, we have to use examples from our physical world. But then, we would only be dealing with physical things, not something completely different that we can't physically sense. If I say the Supreme Being has intelligence, I can only compare it to my own, which relies on sensory information and organizing thoughts. But these thoughts are based on appearances, and because appearances aren't enough, we have to imagine something that doesn't rely on looks or other conditions. If I remove physical senses to imagine a pure intelligence, nothing is left but the basic act of thinking without sensing, which doesn't help us understand anything specific. To understand, I'd have to imagine a different kind of intelligence that can directly know objects, but I can't, because human understanding relies on general ideas and can't directly know things. This same problem happens when we think the Supreme Being has desires like we do. Our idea of will comes from our experience of needing things to feel satisfied. So, this idea involves our senses, which don't match the pure idea of a Supreme Being.",
    "Hume's criticisms of deism are weak because they only target the evidence supporting it, not the core belief itself. However, his arguments against theism, which requires a more precise definition of God compared to deism's broader view, are strong and in many common examples, hard to dispute. Hume argues that just using traits like eternity or omnipotence to define a supreme being isn't enough because they don't give us a clear picture. Instead, we need to add characteristics that describe how this being acts, like its ability to think and make decisions. He particularly focuses on challenging theism, which is stronger than his attacks on deism. The real issue, according to Hume, is anthropomorphism—the idea that we attribute human qualities to God. He believes this idea makes theism unreasonable. If we remove human-like qualities from God, what we're left with is deism, which doesn't offer much value and cannot support religion or morals. If we're stuck with anthropomorphism, then even if we accept all proofs of God's existence, defining God leads to contradictions.",
    "If we connect the rule of not making any judgments that go beyond our pure understanding, with the rule (which seems to contradict it) of developing ideas beyond what we can experience, we find that both can be true at the limits of what reason can lawfully do. These limits apply both to what we can experience and to thoughts we create. This teaches us how these intriguing ideas serve just to outline the limits of human understanding. They warn us not to expand our knowledge too much, as if there's nothing more than the world to understand, and at the same time, remind us not to go beyond our experiences or to make judgments about things that are beyond them, as if they exist independently.",
    "We stop at this point if we only consider how the world might connect to a Being that we can't fully understand. Instead of giving this Supreme Being the same traits we see in our world and becoming overly simplistic in our thinking, we focus on how this Being might relate to our world. This approach allows us to use symbolic language to discuss the Being, without claiming to know its true nature.",
    "If I say we're forced to think of the world as if it were created by a higher intelligence and purpose, I'm really just comparing it to how a watch relates to a watchmaker, a ship to a shipbuilder, or a regiment to its commanding officer. In this way, the world we perceive connects to the Unknown not as it truly is, but as it appears to us or in relation to the world we're part of.",
    "Such understanding is based on analogy, which doesn't mean just a vague likeness between two things. Instead, it involves an exact likeness of relationships between two very different things. Using this analogy, we form an idea of the Supreme Being that is clear enough for our needs, even though we leave out anything that would define it completely or on its own. We define it in relation to the world and to ourselves, and that's enough for us. Hume's criticisms directed at those trying to define this concept by using parts from themselves and the world don't apply to us. He can't argue that we're left with nothing if we abandon making the concept of the Supreme Being strictly human-like.",
    "Let's start by assuming, like Hume's character Philo does for Cleanthes in his dialogues, that the idea of a First Being, or God, is necessary. We think of this Being using basic ideas like substance or cause. We need to do this because our reason, which operates in a world of conditional things, can't be fully satisfied otherwise. This approach avoids anthropomorphism, which means giving human traits to God, because we're just using general ideas that aren't restricted to our worldly experiences.\n\nWe can say this Being affects the world through reason without claiming that God has human-like reason. To understand the world fully with reason, we can assume there's a supreme reason behind everything. This idea is useful and helps us understand nature better. However, this doesn't mean we're saying God himself has human reasoning—only that God relates to the sensible world in a way that aligns with reason.\n\nWe're looking at God as the cause of the world's rational form, but only by analogy. This means we see God as the source of reason in the world without knowing what God is like. This prevents us from forcing human-like ideas onto God and keeps us from wild speculations. It also stops us from misapplying our understanding of the world by suggesting divine reasoning where it's not warranted. Instead of claiming to understand God's nature, we use the idea of a Supreme Reason to better comprehend the world, without assuming the world is enough to explain itself.",
    "The challenges to believing in God fade away when we combine Hume's idea of not using reason beyond what we can experience, with another idea he missed: not thinking that our experiences limit what reason can explore. The Critique of Pure Reason finds a balance between the certainty Hume opposes and the doubt he suggests instead. This balance isn't like a compromise where we mix ideas from each side without achieving clarity. It's a carefully established approach based on principles.",
    "At the start of this explanation, I used the idea of a boundary to clarify the limits of what reason can effectively handle. The visible world consists only of appearances and not the actual essence of things, which the mind must assume exist as 'noumena.' Our reasoning includes both appearances and noumena, so the question is how does reason determine where the mind should limit itself in these areas? Our experiences cover everything we perceive, but they don't define their own limits. These limits exist outside of our experiences, in a realm of pure understanding. However, this realm is like an empty space for us because we can't go beyond what we can experience through defined concepts. Setting boundaries is an active process, applying to what is inside and outside of these limits. It's a real understanding that reason gains by reaching these boundaries but not crossing them, because beyond them is empty space where we can imagine forms, but not actual things. Even though something unknown sets the limits to what the mind can grasp, it's still a type of understanding that relates to reason. This understanding doesn't confine itself within what we perceive, nor does it wander aimlessly outside it but rather looks at the relationship between what's beyond the limit and what's inside it.",
    "Natural theology is an idea that stretches the limits of human reason. It tries to consider the concept of a Supreme Being and, for practical reasons, the idea of a rational world. This is not to claim any specific knowledge about these ideas, which are beyond what we can perceive with our senses, but to help us use our reasoning skills in the most unified way possible. To achieve this, we relate the world we can see to an independent reasoning source, which we see as the cause of all its connections. In doing this, we aren't just making up a being, but since there must be something beyond the physical world that we can only think about with pure reason, we define that something in this way, using analogy.",
    "So, our main point remains: that reason, through its basic principles, only helps us understand things we can potentially experience, and even then, only those aspects we can actually experience. However, this doesn’t stop reason from taking us to the edge of what we can know, pointing toward something beyond our direct experience, which is the basis for all experiences. Still, reason doesn’t tell us anything about this 'thing-in-itself'; it only helps us fully make use of reason within the scope of what we can possibly experience. But this is all we really need, and we should be content with that.",
    "We've described metaphysics as it naturally exists in human reasoning and explained its main goal. Although we've found that our natural reasoning leads us into confusing arguments if it's not guided and limited by scientific critique, such misleading metaphysics doesn't help — and even hinders — our understanding of nature. Still, there's an important question to address: Why does our reasoning have this natural inclination toward complex ideas? Everything in nature is intended to serve a useful purpose.",
    "This question is quite uncertain, and I admit that my thoughts on it are just guesses, similar to any speculation about nature's ultimate purposes. The issue isn't about whether metaphysical judgments are truly valid. Instead, it's about our natural tendency to make these judgments, so it falls under the study of human behavior rather than metaphysics.",
    "When I think about all the deep ideas that make up the main questions of pure reason, which push us to look beyond just observing nature and to think beyond what we usually experience, making us create what we call metaphysics, I sense that the goal is to free our thoughts from being limited by experience and nature. This lets us explore things that only pure understanding can reach, things beyond what we can perceive with our senses. We don't do this to get lost in abstract thought since there's no solid ground there, but because practical principles need this broader vision to meet the universal expectations that reason requires, especially from a moral standpoint.",
    "The Psychological Idea, even though it doesn't fully explain the human soul, still shows that our usual concepts are not enough. This helps steer me away from materialism, which is not very useful for understanding nature and limits our reasoning. The Cosmological Ideas show that understanding nature alone can't fully satisfy our reasoning, and this keeps us from believing that nature can explain everything by itself. Everything in the natural world depends on something else, and if we're looking for something that doesn't depend on anything else, we need to find a cause outside of the natural world. If we only considered natural causes, we could never explain how some things we see exist. Reason helps us escape fatalism—the belief that everything happens because of a blind natural force—by considering the idea of a higher cause, like a Supreme Intelligence, with the ability to choose freely. These transcendental Ideas don't teach us definite facts, but they do help us avoid quick conclusions about Materialism, Naturalism, and Fatalism. They give us room to think about moral ideas beyond just speculation. This, I believe, sheds light on the natural inclination I mentioned before.",
    'The practical value of a purely theoretical science is found outside the science itself and should be viewed as an additional note or supplement, not part of the core science. This value, however, is relevant to philosophy, especially philosophy that comes from pure reasoning, where its theoretical use in metaphysics should align with its practical use in morals. Therefore, the inevitable debate within pure reason in metaphysics, seen as a natural inclination, should not just be dismissed as a mere error to correct. Instead, it should be explained as a natural feature with a purpose, although addressing this is an extra task that does not strictly belong to metaphysics.',
    "The answers to these questions, discussed in the chapter on how we use pure reason, can be seen as additional notes closely related to the topic of metaphysics. In that chapter, certain rational principles are explained that decide the natural order, or how we understand nature's laws through experience, even before we experience it (a priori). These principles seem like they create and govern our experiences, even though they come from pure reason, which isn't like understanding since it isn't a source of possible experiences. Whether this alignment is because nature doesn't exist just in appearances or their origin (our senses) unless it relates to understanding and whether the complete system of all possible experiences relies on the understanding's connection to reason, which might make experience indirectly follow reason’s rules; this might be explored by those interested in examining reason‘s nature beyond its metaphysical uses to include general principles concerning the history of nature. I considered this task significant but did not try to solve it in the book.",

    'Solution to the Main Question of the Introduction: "How Can Metaphysics Be a Science?"',
    "Metaphysics, as a natural tendency of human reason, exists, but if looked at by itself (as discussed in the solution to the third main question), it's misleading and based on illusion. If we try to base principles on it and follow its natural yet incorrect path, we'll never create real science, only a pointless art of argument where one group might temporarily surpass another, but none can achieve true and lasting approval.",
    "For metaphysics to genuinely be considered a science and not just seem like it's grounded in deceptive arguments, we need a Critique of Reason. This critique must lay out all the basic concepts we can know without experience, categorizing them based on their different sources like Sensibility, Understanding, and Reason. It should include a complete list of these concepts, analyze them thoroughly, along with their consequences, and especially explain how we can have knowledge that combines concepts without reference to experience. The critique should show how these concepts can be applied, where their limits are, and present this all in a well-organized system. Only this kind of critique offers a solid and tested plan to establish metaphysics as a science. Doing this any other way is impossible. The real challenge isn't whether this can be done, but how to start this process and encourage intelligent thinkers to abandon their previously unproductive efforts in favor of a more reliable method. It's also about figuring out the best way to unite people for this common goal.",
    "One thing is for sure: once someone experiences Critique, they'll be forever turned off by all the pointless chatter they used to accept, because their mind needs substance and can't settle for anything less.",
    "Critique is to traditional school metaphysics what chemistry is to alchemy or astronomy is to the fortune-teller's astrology. I promise that anyone who fully reads and understands the principles of the Critique, even just in these introductory notes, will never go back to that outdated and misleading pseudo-science. Instead, they'll look forward with some excitement to a kind of metaphysics that they can now truly understand. This new metaphysics doesn't need any more discoveries and finally offers lasting satisfaction to reason. The unique benefit of metaphysics, among all sciences, is that it can reach a point of completion and stability, unable to change or grow with new findings, because reason derives its knowledge from itself, not from observing objects. Once the essential laws of this faculty are clearly explained to avoid confusion, there's nothing left for pure reason to learn on its own, and no further questions need to be asked. This definite and well-organized knowledge is especially appealing, even without considering its other benefits, which I'll talk about later.",
    'All fake art and useless knowledge have their moment, but eventually fade away. Their peak is also when they start to decline. This seems to be true for metaphysics now, as its importance has diminished among educated people, even though other sciences are actively pursued. Universities still have it in their curriculum a little, and occasionally science academies offer awards for essays about it. However, it\'s no longer seen as a serious science. Imagine how a brilliant person would react to being called a "great metaphysician." It might be meant as a compliment, but nowadays not many people would want such a title.',
    "Even though the end of dogmatic metaphysics is definitely here, we're not yet able to say that its rebirth has started through a complete and thorough critique of reason. All shifts from one tendency to its opposite go through a period of indifference, and this phase is the riskiest for an author but, in my view, the best for the field of science. When old alliances have completely dissolved, people are more open to considering different ideas for organizing according to a new plan.",
    "When I say that I hope this introduction will spark interest in critical studies and offer a fresh and promising goal to support the overall spirit of philosophy, which seems to need some encouragement in its speculative side, I can already imagine that everyone who found the challenging parts of my Critique exhausting and frustrating will wonder why I am hopeful. My answer is that it's based on the undeniable necessity of it.",
    "It's unlikely that people will ever stop exploring metaphysical questions, just like we wouldn't stop breathing just to avoid polluted air. So, metaphysics will always exist. Everyone, particularly thoughtful individuals, will have their own version of it since there's no widely accepted standard. The metaphysics we’ve had so far doesn’t satisfy anyone who thinks critically, but we can't just ignore it. That's why we need to explore or thoroughly test a Critique of Pure Reason because it's the only way to address this important need, which is more than just a desire to learn.",
    'Ever since I learned about critique, whenever I finish reading a book about metaphysics that is clear, well-organized, varied, and easy to read, I can\'t help but ask, "Did this author actually make any progress in metaphysics?" I hope the scholars whose work has helped me in other ways, and who have always contributed to my intellectual growth, will forgive me for saying that I have never found either their essays or my own (even though I might be biased towards my own work) to have made any real progress in the field of metaphysics. But why is that?',
    "Here's the main reason: back then, metaphysics wasn't a science and you can't learn it bit by bit; it needs to be completely understood from the start, like in the Critique. To avoid confusion, remember that while analyzing our concepts can teach us a lot, it doesn't really improve metaphysics as a science. These breakdowns of concepts are just the building blocks we need to actually create our science. No matter how well we break down and define concepts like substance and accident, they're just preparation for future work. If we can't prove that substance lasts and only the details change in what's around us, then all our analysis hasn't really moved our science forward.",
    "So far, metaphysics hasn't been able to prove certain basic ideas or more complex theories about subjects like psychology or the universe, nor any sort of new knowledge. Despite all its efforts, nothing has been achieved, and the field remains unchanged since Aristotle's time, even though we have better tools for understanding it today. If only we had found a way to create new knowledge, things might be different.",
    "If anyone feels offended, they're free to disprove my claim by providing a single metaphysical idea they can prove purely by reasoning without any experience. Until they do this, I can't agree they've truly advanced the field of metaphysics, even if common experience seems to support their idea. It's a fair and reasonable request, and if no one can do it, it's fair to say that metaphysics has never really existed as a science.",
    "If the challenge is accepted, there are two things I want to avoid: first, wasting time on guesses and probabilities, which just don't work for deep thinking or math; and second, relying on common sense to make decisions, because it doesn't convince everyone and often just reflects individual biases.",
    "When it comes to metaphysics, it's completely unreasonable to base our judgments on guesswork or probability. Anything we understand before experience, or a priori knowledge, is considered absolutely certain and must be proven with certainty. It would be as illogical as trying to base geometry or arithmetic on guesses. In the realm of probability, we don't deal with uncertain judgments but rather precise calculations about the likelihood of events happening under consistent conditions. These calculations will inevitably be accurate in all possible scenarios, even if each individual outcome is not fully predictable. Guesswork is only appropriate in experimental sciences, and even then, what we assume must be clearly possible.",
    "Saying that common sense can validate concepts and principles without experience is ridiculous. So, what is common sense? It's simply our usual ability to make sound judgments. But more precisely, it's our ability to apply rules in real-life situations, unlike theoretical understanding, which deals with rules in the abstract. Common sense struggles to grasp broad rules like \"every event has a cause\" and only understands them when illustrated through examples, like a broken window or a missing kitchen utensil. It only accepts principles when confirmed by experience. This means understanding them without experience, or a priori, is something only theoretical understanding can do, which is beyond common sense's reach. Metaphysics, which deals with understanding beyond experience, isn't something common sense can help with. Relying on common sense in such cases shows misunderstanding, and people often dismiss it until they're stuck and can’t find answers through speculation.",
    "Some people who pretend to value common sense while often looking down on it claim that there must be some ideas that are obviously true and need no proof because if we kept questioning everything, we'd never stop. However, apart from the principle of contradiction—which isn't enough to prove more complex truths—they can't point to anything undeniable that belongs to common sense, except for things like math equations (e.g., 2 + 2 = 4) or the fact that the shortest path between two points is a straight line. But mathematical truths differ fundamentally from metaphysical ones. In math, I can think through a problem and create what I imagine is possible: I can add numbers myself to get a sum, or imagine drawing lines in my mind. But in metaphysics, I can't just think of something and prove another thing's existence that links directly to the first; I need real-world experience for that. Even though my mind can think of connections like cause and effect before experiencing them, unlike math, I can't just visualize and prove these connections without context. For metaphysics, ideas and their usage need to be proven and justified in advance to understand how they relate to experience and if they can apply beyond direct experience.",
    "In the study of metaphysics, which deals with pure reasoning, we can't rely on common sense. We can only turn to it when we have to give up trying to gain purely speculative knowledge. This means letting go of metaphysics and learning instead to rely on a rational faith, which might be the only thing possible or even more beneficial than knowledge. Here, the focus changes completely. Metaphysics needs to be scientific not just overall, but in all its details; otherwise, it's useless because it relies on broad opinions. However, outside of metaphysics, we can use probability and common sense to our advantage, but only based on specific principles that matter in practical life.",

    'If we look at things as they really are, there are two types of judgments: (1) one type is made before investigating, like when a reader judges the Critique of Pure Reason based on their own beliefs about metaphysics, even though the book is about exploring the possibility of metaphysics; (2) the other type is made after investigating. In the second type, the reader can temporarily set aside any conflicting outcomes from the critical research that go against their pre-existing beliefs about metaphysics and first look at where those outcomes come from. If common beliefs about metaphysics were as certain as geometric theorems, the first type of judgment would be valid. If certain beliefs contradict established truths, those beliefs should be dismissed without further questioning. However, if metaphysics doesn’t have undeniably certain ideas, and even if it has some that seem true but contradict each other, and if there isn’t a clear way to determine the truth of uniquely metaphysical ideas, then the first type of judgment is not suitable. Instead, investigating the principles of the critique needs to happen before making any judgment about its worth.',

However, the public benefits from this analysis. The author also benefits because they get the chance to clarify or correct their ideas early on if they're confident in their basic concepts, potentially improving their book's success.",
    "I find myself, along with the person reviewing my work, in a completely different situation. The reviewer doesn't seem to grasp the main point of the research I've been working on, whether successfully or not. It might be because he doesn't want to spend time on a lengthy project, or he's annoyed by a potential change in a field he thought was already perfected a long time ago, or maybe—and I hope it's not the case—because he is just not open-minded enough. This keeps him stuck in his old way of thinking about the topic. Basically, he quickly goes through a long list of statements without understanding their foundation, criticizes some things, but neither his reasoning nor the statements are clear to the reader. Because of this, his review won't be helpful to the public or criticial to me, at least according to experts. I would've ignored his judgment altogether if it didn’t give me a chance to provide some explanations that might help readers of these notes avoid misunderstandings.",
    'To make it easy for my reviewer to criticize the work without bothering to look into details, he starts and finishes by saying:',
    'This work is a system of higher Idealism.',
    'When I read that line, I quickly realized what kind of criticism I would face. It was as if the reviewer had never encountered geometry before. Imagine someone who finds a book by Euclid, flips through the pages, sees the diagrams, and when asked for their opinion, says: "This book is a drawing guide that uses strange terms to give confusing instructions that ultimately teach nothing more than what anyone can do with a good eye for drawing."',
    "Let's take a look at the kind of idealism that runs throughout my entire work, even though it's not the main focus of the system.",
    'All true idealists, from the Eleatic school to Bishop Berkeley, believe this: "All knowledge gained from our senses and experiences is just an illusion, and truth is only found in the ideas of pure understanding and reason."',
    'The main idea that guides my Idealism is that understanding things purely through reason or intellect without experience is just an illusion, and true knowledge comes only from experience.',
    'But this goes directly against true idealism. So why did I use this term for something completely different, and why did my reviewer find it everywhere?',
    "The solution to this problem is actually simple if you understand the main ideas of the work. Space and time aren't actual things or qualities, but just aspects of how things appear to us. I agree with the idealists on this point. However, these idealists, especially Berkeley, thought space only exists because we experience it and it's just a part of what we see or sense. I disagree and argue that space (and time, which Berkeley didn't think about) can be understood before we even experience them because they are inherent in our minds as forms. This means they allow us to recognize things and their appearances as possible. Since truth relies on universal and necessary laws, Berkeley's view suggests experience can't determine truth as it has no inherent basis, leading to illusion. But we believe that space and time help distinguish truth from illusion by giving structure to possible experiences.",
    "My version of Idealism is unique because it challenges the usual form of Idealism. It gives all knowledge we have before experience, including geometry, a real basis, which wouldn't be possible without my idea that space and time are ideal. Even the most dedicated realists couldn't prove this otherwise. Given this situation, I wish I could have named my concept differently to avoid confusion, but changing it completely wasn't an option. In the future, as I have mentioned before, I might call it formal or better yet, critical Idealism. This name would set it apart from Berkeley's dogmatic Idealism and Descartes' skeptical Idealism.",
    "Beyond this, I don't find anything else noteworthy about the review of my book. The reviewer makes broad criticisms, which is an easy approach because it doesn't reveal how much they actually know. A detailed critique addressing the main point would have either shown my mistake or revealed the reviewer's understanding of this type of research. The reviewer seems to have deliberately selected random passages without context or explanation to discourage readers from wanting to read the book. These passages would sound confusing, especially to those who are not into metaphysical studies. The review goes on with senseless propositions like \"persistent illusion is truth\" and ends with a narrow-minded moral question about the usefulness of challenging conventional language and ideas. This kind of judgment suggests that the reviewer didn't grasp the core ideas of my book, and probably doesn't even understand their own argument.",
    "The reviewer talks like he has some deep understanding that he's not sharing. I don’t see anything new in metaphysics that explains his attitude. He shouldn’t keep his discoveries to himself because there are many people, like me, who haven’t found anything truly groundbreaking in all the writings in this field. We see attempts to redefine terms, patch up weak arguments, or add more confusion to the already messy state of metaphysics. But this isn't what people need. They are tired of vague metaphysical claims; they want to know if the science is even possible, where true knowledge comes from, and how to separate the illusions of pure reason from actual truth. The critic seems to have an answer to this, judging by his confident tone.",
    "I suspect he hasn't really thought about the need for such understanding, because if he had, he would have focused on it, and even a small effort in such an important area would have earned my respect. If that's the case, we'd still be on good terms. He can explore metaphysics as much as he wants without interference, but he can't make judgments on matters outside metaphysics, especially those rooted in reason. My suspicion seems justified because he doesn't mention the possibility of gaining knowledge in a new way before experience, which is crucial for metaphysics, and is the focus of my Critique and Prolegomena. The Idealism he referred to in his comments was just a method to solve this main issue, even though it was supported by other arguments. He should have either shown that the problem isn't as important as I claim, or demonstrated that my approach to perceptions doesn't truly solve it, or that there's a better solution. But I didn't see any of this in his review. It seems he doesn't understand my work or the essence of metaphysics itself. It's hard for me to believe that he was just overwhelmed by the complexity of the work, leading him to misunderstand it.",
    "There's a lot to do before a scholarly journal can keep its well-deserved reputation, no matter how carefully the writers are chosen, especially in metaphysics. Other fields have clear standards. Mathematics relies on itself; history and theology rely on sacred or historical texts; natural sciences and medicine depend on math and practical experience; law depends on legal texts; and even art and taste rely on classical examples. But metaphysics doesn't have an agreed-upon standard yet, and I've tried to define it and explain how it can be used. So what should we do when judging works in this field until the standard is found? If these works are assertive, anyone can do as they please; no one can dominate for long before someone else comes along to challenge them. However, if they critically examine not just other works but reason itself, and the standard is not assumed but sought, then while criticism is allowed, a certain level of patience is necessary. This is because everyone shares this quest for understanding, and jumping to conclusions without the needed insight isn't justified.",
    "To tie my defense to the interests of the broader philosophical community, I suggest a straightforward test to guide all metaphysical research towards a common goal. This is similar to what mathematicians have done in the past by proving the value of their methods through competition. I challenge my critic to fairly prove, using his own method and logical reasoning, even one truly metaphysical principle he claims. Since it's metaphysical, it must be understood through logic rather than experience, and it can be any key principle like the idea that substance remains constant or that events in the world are necessarily caused. If he can't do this (and saying nothing is an admission), he must agree that because metaphysics without certain propositions is meaningless, its feasibility must be thoroughly examined through a critique of pure reason. Therefore, he has to agree that my principles in the Critique are correct, or prove they are invalid. However, I predict that, even though he previously seemed sure of his principles, when actually tested, he won't be able to present even one valid metaphysical principle. To give him an advantage appropriate for such a challenge, I'll take on the responsibility of proof myself.",
    "In my Prolegomena and in my Critique, particularly in the section on the \"Theses and Antitheses of the Four Antinomies,\" there are eight statements that contradict each other in pairs. Each of these statements is crucial to metaphysics and must be accepted or rejected. Every one of these ideas has been supported by some philosopher at some point. You are free to choose any one of these eight statements and accept it without needing to prove it—I'll let you have that—but just one, to avoid wasting both our time. Then, you can challenge my proof of its opposite. If I can defend my argument and also show that, according to universally accepted principles of metaphysics, the opposite of your chosen statement can be just as clearly proven, this confirms a fundamental flaw in metaphysics. It won't be resolved until we look at the root of the issue, which is pure reason, meaning my Critique must either be accepted, replaced with a better one, or at the very least, studied. However, if I can't defend my argument, then you can claim a win for proving a new fundamental truth from standard metaphysical principles, and I'll admit your criticism of my work is justified (though this isn't a likely outcome). For this to work, you might need to reveal your identity. Otherwise, I might find myself dealing with various anonymous and unqualified challenges instead of just one.",
    'Suggestions for Examining Critiques That Could Lead to a Decision.',
    "I'm grateful to the public for the quiet attention they've given to my Critique for a long time. This silence shows they're reserving judgment, suggesting they think there might be value in my work, which explores new ideas and might help revive an important but currently stagnant part of human knowledge. This might have led them to protect my new ideas from quick criticism. Now, I see a careful review of my work in the Gothaischen gelehrten Zeitung, and from the clear presentation of one of my key ideas, anyone can see its thoroughness, aside from my own biased praise.",
    "I suggest that, since a large structure can't be fully understood at a quick glance, we should examine it piece by piece from the ground up. This way, these introductory remarks can be a general guide for comparing with the actual work. If this idea was based solely on my personal pride, like vanity often makes people overly proud of their own creations, it would be arrogant and rightly dismissed. However, speculative philosophy is nearly forgotten now, even though people are deeply attached to it. Even after being repeatedly misled, they struggle to become indifferent to it.",
    "In today's thoughtful world, it's likely that many worthy people would jump at the chance to contribute to the growing pool of knowledge and understanding if there were some prospect of success. Fields like math, science, law, art, and even morality don't completely satisfy us; there's always a part of us that longs for deeper thought. Without this, we might turn to silly distractions or mystical ideas for entertainment, but these are just ways to ignore our restless minds. Our reason naturally seeks something more fulfilling, not just something that caters to our whims or desires. Thinking deeply about reason itself can be incredibly appealing to anyone who tries to broaden their understanding, potentially more so than any other subject. This is because all other knowledge and intentions come together in a unified way when we explore reason.",

Although I am fully content with the content, organization, presentation style, and the effort I put into carefully considering every sentence in the work itself (I’ve spent years making sure I’m satisfied, not just with the whole but with specific details), I’m not completely happy with how I explained some parts of the elements section. For example, in the explanation of the concepts of Understanding or in the discussion about the errors of pure reason, I feel that some parts are too lengthy, which makes them harder to understand. Therefore, I suggest using what is written about these topics in the Prolegomena as a basis for evaluation.',
    "Germans often claim that when it comes to consistent and continuous hard work, they can achieve more than other countries. If this belief is true, there's a business opportunity where success seems almost certain, and which all thoughtful people can participate in, despite previous failures. The reason for past failures is because this particular field of science is unique. Once completed, it reaches a permanent state where it can't be significantly improved or changed by future discoveries, except for clearer explanations or more applications. This makes it unlike any other science, as it stands alone and is concerned solely with pure understanding. Moreover, this seems like a good time for my idea, since in Germany right now, people are looking for meaningful pursuits beyond just practical sciences, aiming for something with lasting value.",
    "I will leave it to others to find out how the efforts of scholars can be combined for this purpose. In the meantime, I just want to encourage people to follow my ideas, even if only to challenge, repeat, limit, confirm, complete, or expand on them where necessary. As long as the subject is thoroughly explored from the beginning, a system will be built—whether or not it's mine—that future generations will appreciate.",
    "Explaining the exact type of metaphysics we can expect once we improve our understanding of criticism would take too long here. However, it's important to know that shedding old, flawed ideas doesn’t leave metaphysics in a poor state. Instead, it can be beautifully and appropriately enriched with new insights. There are clear benefits to reforming our approach in this way. Traditional metaphysics had its merits—it explored core ideas of pure understanding, helping to clarify and define them. This process developed our reasoning skills in various areas. However, its worth was undermined when it encouraged arrogant claims, relied on subtle but misleading methods, or simplified complex issues, blending scientific terms with everyday language to appeal to everyone, yet failing to deliver real substance. Through a critical approach, though, we establish a benchmark for distinguishing genuine knowledge from false claims, laying a solid foundation, especially in metaphysics. This analytical mindset gradually benefits all uses of reason, promoting true philosophical understanding. Moreover, metaphysics significantly aids theology by freeing it from speculative dogma’s constraints, protecting it from such challenges. Unlike traditional metaphysics, which promised but failed to provide support and instead ended up fortifying its critics, critical philosophy dispels mysticism that disguises itself as rationality. Finally, it is crucial for a metaphysics teacher to confidently assert that what they teach is a genuine science, offering real benefits to society.",
